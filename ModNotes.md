## Tribal Essentials Reborn

### Practical Pemmican

The "[Tribal Essentials Reborn](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2597790751)" to have a huge multiplier value on the "Make Pemmican x4" recipe added by "[Practical Pemmican](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2761817611)".  The input is 2.0 nutrition (1.0 veg / 1.0 meat) and produces 64 total pemmican (0.8 nutrition x 64 = 51.2 nutrition) instead of the expected 3.2 nutrition total.  That's a reversion to the standard pemmican recipe which produces x16/x64 amounts of pemmican.

I know this impacts the "Granite Stone Oven" in particular.  I'm not sure if it impacts other cooking spots.  The "stone campfire" seems to be unaffected, so we are cooking with that instead.
