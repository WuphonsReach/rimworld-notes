# 5500

## Apr-12 (Parrot is Medicine Man)

Parrot is promoted to the role of Medicine Man.  Lanca was late to the event.

Tribe hunts a few muffalo for their fur and meat.  Ape takes some damage from a maddened muffalo.

## Apr-13 (Cold Snap)

Cold snap.  Takes temps from 12C down to about 3C.  But nighttime temperatures have dropped below -10C, killing all of the already planted crops.  The colonists only have 18 days left of food.

## Apr-15

Planted Lulabloom in flower pots in the barracks.  This helps reduce/remove the "disturbed sleep" debuff for nearby beds.

Parrot loses his left big toe to a mad muffalo and Lanca lost his left index finger.

## Jul-1

Cold snap ends.  We may struggle with veggies this winter unless the rice, potatoes, green beans and carrots get enough growing days before the fall.

## Jul-5

Basic fence line created, separating us off from the outside world.

## Jul-10 (Borba/Lanca Lovers)

Borba and Lanca are now lovers.  (They seem to be naturally suited for each other given this is the second time it's happened.  I restarted an old save for this playthrough.)

War Merchant from Canca Confederacy (Gentle Tribe, Neutral +0 relations).

## Jul-12

Genetics Supplier from Gaentussia (Civil Outlander Union, Neutral +0).

## Sep-2

Sellswords from Fenthiussia Kingdom (Civil Kingdom, Neutral +0).

## Sep-4 

Royal Tribute Collector from The Gray Sovereignty (Shattered Empire, Neutral +0).

## Sep-6 (Hawk Joins)

Wanderer, Hawk (M63), joins.  A jogger with great memory, but incapable of animal-related work.  Will put him to work on construction, hauling then research.

Current Research Queue:
- Primitive Instruments
- Basic Furniture
- Smithing

Two colonists (Lanca and Elephant) have contracted the flu.  I make Parrot "preach health" to Lanca after doing the initial tending.

## Sep-11 (Hawk Betrayal)

Hawk turns out to be a traitor.  Parrot gets the privilege of meleeing him to death.

Elephant has the workaholic trait, which means he keeps collapsing after working hard away from the colony buildings.  So he's now restricted to the "inner" zone which is a loose zone around our farms and main buildings.  Lanca and Borba are also restricted to the inner zone for safety reasons.

## Sep-12

Bulk Goods Trader from The Serpent Clan (Rough Clan, Neutral +0).

A drought has started, which will eliminate growing on nearly all but rich soil.  Fortunately, it's the end of fall and past our growing season.  Hopefully it goes away by the time we start spring planting.

## Sep-15 (Katlyn Joins)

Accepted Katlyn as a refugee in exchange for 10 days of forced fog weather.  She is a 12 year old child genetically designed as a "highmate" (incapable of violence, designed to be concubines).

Unfortunately for her, she is staggeringly ugly!  And she has ears and a tail.  She does have good cooking and social skills, so we'll see whether she fits in.  We'll have to convert her to our religion as she is currently a vegan who abhors wearing leather and fishing/ranching.

## Dec-2 (Lanca/Borba Engagement)

Lanca/Borba will be getting married soon.  Parrot attempts a 1-on-1 conversion attempt on Katlyn (certainty in her faith dropped to 55%).  This will be followed by a larger ritual at our ceremonial bonfire in three days.  

## Dec-5 (Katlyn Converted)

The drought has ended.  The conversion ritual was held today for Katlyn.  She started with 59%, but ritual quality was only 49%.  Amazingly, it was a masterful conversion ritual and she is now part of our faith.  The attendees all get a +6 mood boost for 6 days.

## Dec-8

Primitive Jubilee week has come.

## Dec-11

Setup a basic "[Life Lessons classroom](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920678419)" for Lanca, Parrot and Borba to teach what they know to Katlyn (and each other).  Parrot only teaches once per season (quadrum).

- Borba (1st, 6th, 11th): Reading and Writing, Basic Fabrication, Basic Mathmatics, Construction
- Lanca (2nd, 7th, 12th): Basic Fabrication, Cooking
- Parrot (15th): Basic Fabrication, Tailoring

The neolithic tech of Primitive Instruments has completed.  I can now build a Marimba for another source of recreation.  We need (per "[Tech Advance]() mod") to complete 75% of all neolithic techs before we can advanced to medieval tech research.  Unless we advance, the next tier of research costs 10x the standard costs.

## Dec-15

The Black Delta Settlement calls us and demands $783 silver for "protection".  We refuse.

# 5501

## Apr-1 (Katlyn Adulthood)

Katyln becomes an adult (F13), but is still a teenager for some game mechanics.  Given that she only arrived a quadrum prior, she only gets to pick from 1 skill and 1 trait.  She gets plants as a passion and the perfectionist trait.  Still incapable of violence.

We have about 34 days of food left (mostly pemmican).

## Apr-3 (Borba/Lanca Marriage)

Parrot and Elephant get into a social fight.  Borba and Lanca get married.

## Apr-12 (Llobai Joins)

Planting has begun over the past week.

A wanderer named Llobai wants to join the colony.  He is age 47, belongs to our ideology and is a big-boned perfectionist menagerist but is incapable of caring.  Passions in melee and animals.  He'll make an okay hunter/hauler.

Unfortunately, with the colonist growth we now have a -15 mood due to not having any megaliths built for our ideology.  But that's a medieval technology that we don't have yet and would be a 24,000 research point effort (compared to the 500-2000 point technologies that we are currently researching).

## Jul-1

Thugs from Bekisdus Pact called and offered "protection" for $837 silver.  Naturally, we refused.

## Jul-3 (Llobai Betryal)

We are now zero for two on joiners.  Llobai is betraying us.

## Jul-8

A space battle is occurring overhead and random junk is now crashing to the ground in the southwest corner of the map.  To avoid any of our colonists being killed, we're restricting movement.

And now a feralisk clutch mother has shown up.  Yet another reason to hide away for a while.  It can't survive below -12C and winter is coming.

## Jul-9

Finished "Basic Furniture" research.  Now we're going to try and tech-rush "Basic Work Benches" and then "Stonecutting" in order to unlock Megaliths in a year or three.  Assuming that [Life Lessons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920678419) doesn't prevent that.

Actually... scratch that.  Given the disparity in research difficulty, we should focus on completing our neolithic techs.

## Jul-11

An early cold snap in the last part of the fall.  This should kill off the feralisks.  Or not, it wore off after only two days and didn't get cold enough to impact them.

## Sep-9

The feralisks are gone.  Probably due to the weather getting below -15C.

## Dec-3 (Akira Joins)

A child named Akira (M10) wants to join.  Since they are a child, we will let them in.  He is greedy with a vow of non-violence.  Only has basic passions for mining and social.  We'll need to convert him to our ideology and will immediately hold the group ritual.

Ritual got his certainty down to just 16%, but failed to convert.  Parrot will do a one-on-one conversion in three days.

## Dec-6 (Nails Joins)

Another child, Nails (M8), wants to join.  He's young enough that his only trait is animal lover with a passion for crafting.  

Parrot wore Akira down to just 3% certainty, but failed to convert.

## Dec-7

This evening is the annual Primeval Jubilee.  It was unforgettable, giving us +20 with The Orange Oasis Settlement and giving us enough points to reform our ideology.

Going to add Collectivist for our second meme, then pickup Immunity:Enhanced for a precept.

## Dec-13 (Akira Converts)

Parrot finally converted Akira to our ideology.

# 5502

## Apr-2

Borba has agreed that the tribe will watch a pet gila monster for 14 days.  It is the pet of Palatina Bryennios, a praetor of The Gray Sovereignty (empire).  The reward is +9 honor for Borba.  It's an omnivore and has paralytic abasia, so we'll need the animal tenders to watch it and feed it.

Borba and Katlyn are both now on research duties, except during planting and harvesting season.

## Apr-7

Because of negative mood debuffs due to his prior religion, Akira is now following Nails around and insulting him non-stop.

Parrot attempts to convert Nails.  Reduced Nails certainty from 100% to just 82%.  Pretty good for a first attempt.

## Apr-9

Nails reaches age ten and gains the trait, early bird.  He did not learn enough to get any passions.

## Apr-11 (Nails Converts)

Conversion ritual for Nails.  A masterful ritual converted Nails to our ideology.

## Jul-2

It's been a long time since our last trade caravan.  I think the last one we had was in Sep 5501, almost two years ago.

The empire's pet has survived and was launched on the shuttle in the early hours.  Borba is now a freeholder in the empire.

## Jul-12 (Elephant/Katlyn Lovers)

Bulk goods trader from Eveeron Accord (Civil Outlander Union, Neutral +0) and one of the guards, Zlata, is Lanca's sister.  They have some textbooks for sale (tailoring, computers, advanced fabrication).  

Elephant (M19) and Katyln (F16) are now lovers.  Due to Katyln's genetic background (highmate) they are now permanently bonded and one will go insane if the other one dies.  They will also be unhappy if both are not on the same map.

## Jul-14 (Akira Adulthood, Skiphound)

Akira (M13) is now nicknamed 'Bell' and has become an adult.  He picked up the iron stomach trait and a burning passion for mining with some passion for intellectual pursuits.  He's still a pacifist.

Ape managed to tame the skiphound (F, age 2) and named her 'Bonnie'.

## Jul-15

A weaponsmith caravan from Fenthiussia Kingdom (Civil Kingdom, Neutral +0) is visiting.  They have a pair of smilodon (M9, F28).  Given that they usually only live 30 years, the age of the female is concerning.  But maybe they'll have a litter before she dies.  Their filth rate is only 1.0 (compared to the 2.0 of the skiphound).

I think... I'm going to pass.  The age of the female smilodon is very concerning.

## Sep-3 (Elephant Loses Arm)

Ape/Elephant have a social fight at the binge party started by Parrot.  To add insult to injury, Lanca fails to tend properly and removes Elephant's left arm!  This can happen due to Life Lessons if the tending pawn does not have the First Aid skill.

## Sep-6

Bulk goods trader from Canca Confederacy (Gentle Tribe, Neutral +1)

## Sep-12

Exotic goods trader from Eveeron Accord (Civil Outlander Union, Neutral +11).  This trader has the telescope for another source of joy!  We're also going to pick up a pair of leather-bound books on shooting ([Vanilla Books Expanded mod]()).

## Sep-13

Feast, hosted by Parrot.

## Dec-1

Genetics supplier from Confederacy of Esler (Civil Xenohuman Union, Neutral +0).

Lanca teaches "Basic Fabrication" and "Cooking" every 5th day, but all of the colonists except for Elephant and Ape have mastered those personal skills.  That means Lanca's classes will be getting cancelled for the forseeable future.

## Dec-5

Lanca/Ape social fight.  Hopefully the two of them heal in time for the Primitive Jubilee.

## Dec-7 (Primitive Jubilee)

Primitive Jubilee.  Lanca was able to attend, with a limp.  It was a beautiful festival, getting us up to +65 with Orange Oasis Settlement.

Nails is almost an adult (age 13) and has learned up to tier 7.  This will give him 2 passions from 4 options and 1 trait from 4 options.  I plan on Nails taking over the hauling/cleaning duties from Bell (Akira) and then put Bell into the quarry.

## Dec-10 (Gut Worms)

Three of our colonists are sick with gut worms: Ape, Lanca, Parrot.

Nails hit teir 8.  Which will give him 3 passions from 6 options and 1 trait from 6 options.

## Dec-11 (Nails Adulthood)

He picks up the tough trait, passion for shooting/construction and a burning passion in crafting.

# 5503

Still stuck in neolithic technologies.  As Spring approaches, we have to take Borba off of prioritized research duties and have her do farming.

## Apr-3

Parrot/Nails social fight.  

## Apr-5

Ape goes on an insulting spree targeted at Nails.

## Apr-7 (Elephant/Katryn Engagement)

Elephant/Katryn are now engaged to be married.

## Apr-13

The empire's tribute collector (Philaros, awakenend android) is visiting.  

## Apr-15

Shaman merchant from The Purple Frog Tol (Gentle Tribe, Neutral +0) is visiting.

## Jul-3

Animal herder from Fenthiussia Kingdom (Civil Kingdom).

## Jul-4 (Katlyn Pregnancy)

Katyln is pregnant.  

## Jul-5 (Shuttle Crash)

A shuttle crashed nearby, destroying part of our bridge over the southwest swamp.  

## Jul-13

We have achieved a cornerstone point for our civilization due to our work on research.  The "Cult of Inner Strength" feels right as it lowers our mental break threshold by 5% and makes everyone more resilient from bad thoughts.

## Sep-2 (Katlyn's Baby Prep)

Six days until birth, time to start preparations.  We already have some baby food and a crib.

I caught Nails reading the leather-bound shooting book, which boosted his shooting skill.

## Sep-7 (Blizzarisk Clutch Mother)

There's now a Blizzarisk Clutch Mother outside the walls.  Since it's almost winter, we have plenty of pemmican, and we are preparing for a birth -- I'm just going to restrict everyone to the "Inner1" zone which is the growing areas and the main buildings.  Well away from any exterior walls.  I don't want to send Ape/Nails to their death fighting it.

## Sep-8 (Hunting Party, Katyln Labor)

A hunting party from The Green Stream Settlement (Civil Settlers) is passing by.  They are armed with more modern weapons.  Maybe after they hunt all the muffalo on the map they'll go after the blizzarisks.  Ah, no luck.  They each killed a muffalo and then exited the map with it.

Katlyn goes into labor.  We have an 89% of a healthy baby and a 1.3% chance of the mother's death.  Lanca has 10 in medicine and will be the attending doctor.

## Sep-9 (Finch is born)

Finch has been born to Katyln/Elephant.  A healthy baby girl.

Ape/Lanca get into a social fight. 

This Life Lessons mod is brutal.  Elephant lost an arm ages ago due to Lanca's poor First Aid skill and now Ape loses an arm while being tended to by Parrot.

## Sep-10 (Medieval Technology Tier)

We've advanced to the medieval technology level.  Now we can start the research needed for megaliths.  We need one per every third colonist and we already have a population of nine.  Each megalith takes 550 stone blocks, so we'll need to work on that as well.

## Sep-12

The shattered empire's tribute collector (Herkalos, hussar) is visiting.  We have no gold for tribute this season.

## Dec-3

Finished the stonecutting research which unlocks the Megalith structure (under the miscellaneous category).  We have saved up the 1100 marble stone blocks for a pair of them to be built right away.

Meanwhile, outside the walls, there are now thirteen tiny blizzarisk running around in addition to their clutch mother.

## Dec-7

Primitive Jubilee held after sunset.  

## Dec-13

The blizzarisk clutch mother has finally left the map, leaving behind 15 blizzarisk of various sizes.  They have started hunting anything that moves.

We have constructed three megaliths and are working on a 4th.  This eliminated the -15 mood penalty of everyone in our ideology as we didn't have enough of them built.

# 5504

## Apr-7

Still a bunch of blizzarisk on the map.  Here comes an exotic goods trader from Eveeron Accord (Civil Outlander Union).  We'll buy a fur-cover intellectual book and a pair of engineering textbooks.  

## Apr-11

War merchant from Camisa Nation (Multicultural Tribe).

NOTE: I am having problems figuring out why I can't research "Complex Furniture".  The message in the UI is "missing research spot".  I suspect a mod conflict, but I'm not sure which/what yet.  To troubleshoot this, I turned off "[Research Tree (Continued)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3030499331)" and then loaded the save.  Then I looked at the research node again and found that it uses a "Research Spot" in the miscellaneous category.  Which is not the same as the tribal level research spot in the production category.  This bug may be caused by "Vanilla Factions Expanded - Tribals" or at least that is the mod which adds the "Research Spot" under the miscellaneous category.

## Apr-15 (Borba Pregnancy)

Borba/Lanca are now expecting.  Given that Borba (F37) is older than Katlyn (F19), this is a riskier pregnancy.

## Jul-4

Well, all the blizzarisk have vanished, but now a feralisk clutch mother shows up.

## Jul-7

Space battle over the western half of the map.  Maybe we'll get lucky and a chunk will land on the feralisk clutch mother.
