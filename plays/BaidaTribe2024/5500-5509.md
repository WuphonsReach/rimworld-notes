# 5500

## Aprimay-12

Parrot is promoted to the role of Medicine Man.  Lanca was late to the event.

Tribe hunts a few muffalo for their fur and meat.  Ape takes some damage from a maddened muffalo.

## Aprimay-13

Cold snap.  Takes temps from 12C down to about 3C.  But nighttime temperatures have dropped below -10C, killing all of the already planted crops.  The colonists only have 18 days left of food.

## Apr-15

Planted Lulabloom in flower pots in the barracks.  This helps reduce/remove the "disturbed sleep" debuff for nearby beds.

Parrot loses his left big toe to a mad muffalo and Lanca lost his left index finger.

## Jul-1

Cold snap ends.  We may struggle with veggies this winter unless the rice, potatoes, green beans and carrots get enough growing days before the fall.

## Jul-5

Basic fence line created, separating us off from the outside world.

## Jul-10

Borba and Lanca are now lovers.  (They seem to be naturally suited for each other given this is the second time it's happened.  I restarted an old save for this playthrough.)

War Merchant from Canca Confederacy (Gentle Tribe, Neutral +0 relations).

## Jul-12

Genetics Supplier from Gaentussia (Civil Outlander Union, Neutral +0).

## Sep-2

Sellswords from Fenthiussia Kingdom (Civil Kingdom, Neutral +0).

## Sep-4 

Royal Tribute Collector from The Gray Sovereignty (Shattered Empire, Neutral +0).

## Sep-6

Wanderer, Hawk (M63), joins.  A jogger with great memory, but incapable of animal-related work.  Will put him to work on construction, hauling then research.

Current Research Queue:
- Primitive Instruments
- Basic Furniture
- Smithing

Two colonists (Lanca and Elephant) have contracted the flu.  I make Parrot "preach health" to Lanca after doing the initial tending.

## Sep-11

Hawk turns out to be a traitor.  Parrot gets the privilege of meleeing him to death.

Elephant has the workaholic trait, which means he keeps collapsing after working hard away from the colony buildings.  So he's now restricted to the "inner" zone which is a loose zone around our farms and main buildings.  Lanca and Borba are also restricted to the inner zone for safety reasons.

## Sep-12

Bulk Goods Trader from The Serpent Clan (Rough Clan, Neutral +0).

A drought has started, which will eliminate growing on nearly all but rich soil.  Fortunately, it's the end of fall and past our growing season.  Hopefully it goes away by the time we start spring planting.

## Sep-15

Accepted Katlyn as a refugee in exchange for 10 days of forced fog weather.  She is a 12 year old child genetically designed as a "highmate" (incapable of violence, designed to be concubines).

Unfortunately for her, she is staggeringly ugly!  And she has ears and a tail.  She does have good cooking and social skills, so we'll see whether she fits in.  We'll have to convert her to our religion as she is currently a vegan who abhors wearing leather and fishing/ranching.

## Dec-2

Lanca/Borba will be getting married soon.  Parrot attempts a 1-on-1 conversion attempt on Katlyn (certainty in her faith dropped to 55%).  This will be followed by a larger ritual at our ceremonial bonfire in three days.  

## Dec-5

The drought has ended.  The conversion ritual was held today for Katlyn.  She started with 59%, but ritual quality was only 49%.  Amazingly, it was a masterful conversion ritual and she is now part of our faith.  The attendees all get a +6 mood boost for 6 days.

## Dec-8

Primitive Jubilee week has come.

## Dec-11

Setup a basic "[Life Lessons classroom](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920678419)" for Lanca, Parrot and Borba to teach what they know to Katlyn (and each other).  Parrot only teaches once per season (quadrum).

- Borba (1st, 6th, 11th): Reading and Writing, Basic Fabrication, Basic Mathmatics, Construction
- Lanca (2nd, 7th, 12th): Basic Fabrication, Cooking
- Parrot (15th): Basic Fabrication, Tailoring

The neolithic tech of Primitive Instruments has completed.  I can now build a Marimba for another source of recreation.  We need (per "[Tech Advance]() mod") to complete 75% of all neolithic techs before we can advanced to medieval tech research.  Unless we advance, the next tier of research costs 10x the standard costs.

## Dec-15

The Black Delta Settlement calls us and demands $783 silver for "protection".  We refuse.

# 5501

## Apr-1

Katyln becomes an adult (F13), but is still a teenager for some game mechanics.  Given that she only arrived a quadrum prior, she only gets to pick from 1 skill and 1 trait.  She gets plants as a passion and the perfectionist trait.  Still incapable of violence.

We have about 34 days of food left (mostly pemmican).

## Apr-3

Parrot and Elephant get into a social fight.  

## Apr-12

Planting has begun over the past week.

A wanderer named Llobai wants to join the colony.  He is age 47, belongs to our ideology and is a big-boned perfectionist menagerist but is incapable of caring.  Passions in melee and animals.  He'll make an okay hunter/hauler.

Unfortunately, with the colonist growth we now have a -15 mood due to not having any megaliths built for our ideology.  But that's a medieval technology that we don't have yet and would be a 24,000 research point effort (compared to the 500-2000 point technologies that we are currently researching).

## Jul-1

Thugs from Bekisdus Pact called and offered "protection" for $837 silver.  Naturally, we refused.

## Jul-3

We are now zero for two on joiners.  Llobai is betraying us.

## Jul-8

A space battle is occurring overhead and random junk is now crashing to the ground in the southwest corner of the map.  To avoid any of our colonists being killed, we're restricting movement.

And now a feralisk clutch mother has shown up.  Yet another reason to hide away for a while.  It can't survive below -12C and winter is coming.

## Jul-9

Finished "Basic Furniture" research.  Now we're going to try and tech-rush "Basic Work Benches" and then "Stonecutting" in order to unlock Megaliths in a year or three.  Assuming that [Life Lessons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920678419) doesn't prevent that.

Actually... scratch that.  Given the disparity in research difficulty, we should focus on completing our neolithic techs.

## Jul-11

An early cold snap in the last part of the fall.  This should kill off the feralisks.  Or not, it wore off after only two days and didn't get cold enough to impact them.

## Sep-9

The feralisks are gone.  Probably due to the weather getting below -15C.

## Dec-3

A child named Akira (M10) wants to join.  Since they are a child, we will let them in.  He is greedy with a vow of non-violence.  Only has basic passions for mining and social.  We'll need to convert him to our ideology and will immediately hold the group ritual.

Ritual got his certainty down to just 16%, but failed to convert.  Parrot will do a one-on-one conversion in three days.

## Dec-6

Another child, Nails (M8), wants to join.  He's young enough that his only trait is animal lover with a passion for crafting.  

Parrot wore Akira down to just 3% certainty, but failed to convert.

## Dec-7

This evening is the annual Primeval Jubilee.  It was unforgettable, giving us +20 with The Orange Oasis Settlement and giving us enough points to reform our ideology.

Going to add Collectivist for our second meme, then pickup Immunity:Enhanced for a precept.
