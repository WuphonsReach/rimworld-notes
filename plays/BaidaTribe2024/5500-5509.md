# 5500

## Apr-12 (Parrot is Medicine Man)

Parrot is promoted to the role of Medicine Man.  Lanca was late to the event.

Tribe hunts a few muffalo for their fur and meat.  Ape takes some damage from a maddened muffalo.

## Apr-13 (Cold Snap)

Cold snap.  Takes temps from 12C down to about 3C.  But nighttime temperatures have dropped below -10C, killing all of the already planted crops.  The colonists only have 18 days left of food.

## Apr-15

Planted Lulabloom in flower pots in the barracks.  This helps reduce/remove the "disturbed sleep" debuff for nearby beds.

Parrot loses his left big toe to a mad muffalo and Lanca lost his left index finger.

## Jul-1

Cold snap ends.  We may struggle with veggies this winter unless the rice, potatoes, green beans and carrots get enough growing days before the fall.

## Jul-5

Basic fence line created, separating us off from the outside world.

## Jul-10 (Borba/Lanca Lovers)

Borba and Lanca are now lovers.  (They seem to be naturally suited for each other given this is the second time it's happened.  I restarted an old save for this playthrough.)

War Merchant from Canca Confederacy (Gentle Tribe, Neutral +0 relations).

## Jul-12

Genetics Supplier from Gaentussia (Civil Outlander Union, Neutral +0).

## Sep-2

Sellswords from Fenthiussia Kingdom (Civil Kingdom, Neutral +0).

## Sep-4 

Royal Tribute Collector from The Gray Sovereignty (Shattered Empire, Neutral +0).

## Sep-6 (Hawk Joins)

Wanderer, Hawk (M63), joins.  A jogger with great memory, but incapable of animal-related work.  Will put him to work on construction, hauling then research.

Current Research Queue:
- Primitive Instruments
- Basic Furniture
- Smithing

Two colonists (Lanca and Elephant) have contracted the flu.  I make Parrot "preach health" to Lanca after doing the initial tending.

## Sep-11 (Hawk Betrayal)

Hawk turns out to be a traitor.  Parrot gets the privilege of meleeing him to death.

Elephant has the workaholic trait, which means he keeps collapsing after working hard away from the colony buildings.  So he's now restricted to the "inner" zone which is a loose zone around our farms and main buildings.  Lanca and Borba are also restricted to the inner zone for safety reasons.

## Sep-12

Bulk Goods Trader from The Serpent Clan (Rough Clan, Neutral +0).

A drought has started, which will eliminate growing on nearly all but rich soil.  Fortunately, it's the end of fall and past our growing season.  Hopefully it goes away by the time we start spring planting.

## Sep-15 (Katlyn Joins)

Accepted Katlyn as a refugee in exchange for 10 days of forced fog weather.  She is a 12 year old child genetically designed as a "highmate" (incapable of violence, designed to be concubines).

Unfortunately for her, she is staggeringly ugly!  And she has ears and a tail.  She does have good cooking and social skills, so we'll see whether she fits in.  We'll have to convert her to our religion as she is currently a vegan who abhors wearing leather and fishing/ranching.

## Dec-2 (Lanca/Borba Engagement)

Lanca/Borba will be getting married soon.  Parrot attempts a 1-on-1 conversion attempt on Katlyn (certainty in her faith dropped to 55%).  This will be followed by a larger ritual at our ceremonial bonfire in three days.  

## Dec-5 (Katlyn Converted)

The drought has ended.  The conversion ritual was held today for Katlyn.  She started with 59%, but ritual quality was only 49%.  Amazingly, it was a masterful conversion ritual and she is now part of our faith.  The attendees all get a +6 mood boost for 6 days.

## Dec-8

Primitive Jubilee week has come.

## Dec-11

Setup a basic "[Life Lessons classroom](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920678419)" for Lanca, Parrot and Borba to teach what they know to Katlyn (and each other).  Parrot only teaches once per season (quadrum).

- Borba (1st, 6th, 11th): Reading and Writing, Basic Fabrication, Basic Mathmatics, Construction
- Lanca (2nd, 7th, 12th): Basic Fabrication, Cooking
- Parrot (15th): Basic Fabrication, Tailoring

The neolithic tech of Primitive Instruments has completed.  I can now build a Marimba for another source of recreation.  We need (per "[Tech Advance]() mod") to complete 75% of all neolithic techs before we can advanced to medieval tech research.  Unless we advance, the next tier of research costs 10x the standard costs.

## Dec-15

The Black Delta Settlement calls us and demands $783 silver for "protection".  We refuse.

# 5501

## Apr-1 (Katlyn Adulthood)

Katyln becomes an adult (F13), but is still a teenager for some game mechanics.  Given that she only arrived a quadrum prior, she only gets to pick from 1 skill and 1 trait.  She gets plants as a passion and the perfectionist trait.  Still incapable of violence.

We have about 34 days of food left (mostly pemmican).

## Apr-3 (Borba/Lanca Marriage)

Parrot and Elephant get into a social fight.  Borba and Lanca get married.

## Apr-12 (Llobai Joins)

Planting has begun over the past week.

A wanderer named Llobai wants to join the colony.  He is age 47, belongs to our ideology and is a big-boned perfectionist menagerist but is incapable of caring.  Passions in melee and animals.  He'll make an okay hunter/hauler.

Unfortunately, with the colonist growth we now have a -15 mood due to not having any megaliths built for our ideology.  But that's a medieval technology that we don't have yet and would be a 24,000 research point effort (compared to the 500-2000 point technologies that we are currently researching).

## Jul-1

Thugs from Bekisdus Pact called and offered "protection" for $837 silver.  Naturally, we refused.

## Jul-3 (Llobai Betryal)

We are now zero for two on joiners.  Llobai is betraying us.

## Jul-8

A space battle is occurring overhead and random junk is now crashing to the ground in the southwest corner of the map.  To avoid any of our colonists being killed, we're restricting movement.

And now a feralisk clutch mother has shown up.  Yet another reason to hide away for a while.  It can't survive below -12C and winter is coming.

## Jul-9

Finished "Basic Furniture" research.  Now we're going to try and tech-rush "Basic Work Benches" and then "Stonecutting" in order to unlock Megaliths in a year or three.  Assuming that [Life Lessons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920678419) doesn't prevent that.

Actually... scratch that.  Given the disparity in research difficulty, we should focus on completing our neolithic techs.

## Jul-11

An early cold snap in the last part of the fall.  This should kill off the feralisks.  Or not, it wore off after only two days and didn't get cold enough to impact them.

## Sep-9

The feralisks are gone.  Probably due to the weather getting below -15C.

## Dec-3 (Akira Joins)

A child named Akira (M10) wants to join.  Since they are a child, we will let them in.  He is greedy with a vow of non-violence.  Only has basic passions for mining and social.  We'll need to convert him to our ideology and will immediately hold the group ritual.

Ritual got his certainty down to just 16%, but failed to convert.  Parrot will do a one-on-one conversion in three days.

## Dec-6 (Nails Joins)

Another child, Nails (M8), wants to join.  He's young enough that his only trait is animal lover with a passion for crafting.  

Parrot wore Akira down to just 3% certainty, but failed to convert.

## Dec-7

This evening is the annual Primeval Jubilee.  It was unforgettable, giving us +20 with The Orange Oasis Settlement and giving us enough points to reform our ideology.

Going to add Collectivist for our second meme, then pickup Immunity:Enhanced for a precept.

## Dec-13 (Akira Converts)

Parrot finally converted Akira to our ideology.

# 5502

## Apr-2

Borba has agreed that the tribe will watch a pet gila monster for 14 days.  It is the pet of Palatina Bryennios, a praetor of The Gray Sovereignty (empire).  The reward is +9 honor for Borba.  It's an omnivore and has paralytic abasia, so we'll need the animal tenders to watch it and feed it.

Borba and Katlyn are both now on research duties, except during planting and harvesting season.

## Apr-7

Because of negative mood debuffs due to his prior religion, Akira is now following Nails around and insulting him non-stop.

Parrot attempts to convert Nails.  Reduced Nails certainty from 100% to just 82%.  Pretty good for a first attempt.

## Apr-9

Nails reaches age ten and gains the trait, early bird.  He did not learn enough to get any passions.

## Apr-11 (Nails Converts)

Conversion ritual for Nails.  A masterful ritual converted Nails to our ideology.

## Jul-2

It's been a long time since our last trade caravan.  I think the last one we had was in Sep 5501, almost two years ago.

The empire's pet has survived and was launched on the shuttle in the early hours.  Borba is now a freeholder in the empire.

## Jul-12 (Elephant/Katlyn Lovers)

Bulk goods trader from Eveeron Accord (Civil Outlander Union, Neutral +0) and one of the guards, Zlata, is Lanca's sister.  They have some textbooks for sale (tailoring, computers, advanced fabrication).  

Elephant (M19) and Katyln (F16) are now lovers.  Due to Katyln's genetic background (highmate) they are now permanently bonded and one will go insane if the other one dies.  They will also be unhappy if both are not on the same map.

## Jul-14 (Akira Adulthood, Skiphound)

Akira (M13) is now nicknamed 'Bell' and has become an adult.  He picked up the iron stomach trait and a burning passion for mining with some passion for intellectual pursuits.  He's still a pacifist.

Ape managed to tame the skiphound (F, age 2) and named her 'Bonnie'.

## Jul-15

A weaponsmith caravan from Fenthiussia Kingdom (Civil Kingdom, Neutral +0) is visiting.  They have a pair of smilodon (M9, F28).  Given that they usually only live 30 years, the age of the female is concerning.  But maybe they'll have a litter before she dies.  Their filth rate is only 1.0 (compared to the 2.0 of the skiphound).

I think... I'm going to pass.  The age of the female smilodon is very concerning.
