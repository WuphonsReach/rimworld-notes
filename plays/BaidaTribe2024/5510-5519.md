# 5510

## Apr-2

Our annual Unity Celebration (Drum Festival) starts this evening.

## Apr-5

Fungoid ship on the west side of the southwest marshlands.

## Apr-7 (Wasp Adulthood)

Wasp becomes an adult.  He's picking up the Tough trait to go with Pretty and Industrious.  And passions in crafting, art and shooting.

## Apr-9

Grant (F18) goes into labor at 1am.  She gives birth at 2am, lightning fast.  Iroscuga 'Ferret' Grant is a healthy boy.

It's also planting day.  The frost overnight did kill off some fresh seedlings, but all the growers are busy today replanting.

Bulk Goods Trader from Orange Oasis Settlement (Civil Settlers).  They are one of our nearby neighbors and we try to stay allied with them through our annual festivals and trade.  They brought a lot of textbooks for Life Lessons, which is going to be helpful as we try and break into the industrial age technologies.  Katryn is still researching (theory/pioneering) Electronics on her own. We unlocked the Industrial Technology Tier back at the very end of 5507.  Which is about two years ago, but our pawns don't have the personal skills (Life Lessons) to research some of the technologies like Electricity.

## Apr-15 (Eagle, Age 3)

Eagle has become a child.
