# 5500

## Apr-1-5500

The gods were angry.  We've escaped with what we could and have found a cirque to hole up in.

## Apr-3-5500 (Raid, Virus Crew)

A single pawn raid by Virus Crew.


## Apr-11-5500 (Caravans Start Arriving)

Caravans start arriving.

- 11th: Bulk goods trader from Central Republic.

Senga becomes the Medicine Man for the tribe.

## Jul-3-5500 (Sylvie and Hornet as doctors)

Start with Sylvie and Hornet as the primary doctors.  They'll be going down the "Protector" psycast tree for healing abilities.

## Jul-9-5500 (Miah Joins)

Miah (M32) has shown up being chased by manhunting panthers.  He has a mix of traits: quick sleeper, volatile, coward.  The volatile trait was almost a rejection but he has burning passions for mining and plants.  He is incapable of caring duties.

## Jul-12-5500 (Raid, Pigmoili)

Raiders from Pigmoili.  Pair of pigskin xenotypes with short ranged weapons.

## Jul-13-5500 (Raid, Southwest Seeremebum, Psycaster)

Southwest Seeremebum is attacking and one of the three is a psycaster with a biocoded charge LMG.  Five of our colonists are down with various wounds from the LMG.  Hornet is going to be busy as Sylvie is downed and Senga doesn't do doctoring.  

Hornet has linked to the anima tree and casts her first two Word of Healing on Sylvie and Abere.

## Jul-15-5500 (Senga Loaned Out)

Going to loan Senga out to The Purple Empire for 10 days.  This gives her "First of her Name" which increases her standing in the empire.

## Sep-1-5500 (Elm Joins)

Elm (a female poluxkin, age 33) is fleeing from Nicole's Tomahawks and wants refuge.  Poluxkin are immune to pollution and excellent at plants.  She is an anxious academian and zero skills in violence (but not incapable).  Super burning passions for mining and plants.  Burning passion for medical and a skill of 13.  She's already converted to Primitive Creed (our ideology) so no need to convert later.  

## Sep-15-5500 (Raid, White Crag Bandits)

Single pawn raid from White Crag Bandits with a shotgun.

## Dec-1-5500 (Violence Quest)

We agreed to have three raid parties divert to us in exchange for shattered empire rewards.  One of them dropped a normal quality bolt-action rifle for Green with a range of 37 and damage of 18.  Hornet also picks one up from the 3rd raid.

## Dec-3-5500 (Miah/Elm Lovers)

Miah (M32 baseliner) and Elm (F33 poluxkin) are now lovers.

## Dec-6-5500 (Green Anima Tree)

Green has linked to the anima tree and is leveling up in the Technomancer psycast tree.

## Dec-7-5500 (Primeval Jubilee)

This occurs at around 2300 on the 7th, so might frequently happen on the 8th.  Our first one was unimpressive.

## Dec-10-5500 (Raid, Raareentium)

Outlanders from Raareentium are attacking.  The north trio got set upon by a warg, killing one of the three and injuring another.  

## Dec-14-5500 (Raid, Gray Owl Clan)

Pillagers from Gray Owl Clan are attacking.  One of them ran off with a corpse, which is always amusing to me.

# 5501

## Apr-1-5501

Abere has also linked to the anima tree and picked up Technomancer.

## Apr-4-5501 (Raid, Purple Sound Settlement)

A single raider from The Purple Sound Settlement is attacking.

## Apr-5-5501 (Six psycasters)

All of the originals now have psycasting:

- Green: Technomancer
- Abere: Technomancer
- Red: Empath
- Sylvie: Protector
- Hornet: Protector
- Senga: Empath

## Apr-6-5501 (Yuu's Sad Travelers)

Three people, including a child, claim to have escaped a slave caravan and want to stay with us for 9 days.

- Yuu (M34 genie): test subject, escaped convict
- Lion (F56, baseliner): eldest caretaker, barber
- Niko (M10, nizai): requires wake-up to function

## Apr-12-5501 (Raid, Virus Crew)

Virus Crew is attacking, but some mechs followed them so the two groups are fighting on the map edge.

## Apr-14-5501 (Travelers Leave)

Yuu's Sad Travelers left without incident.

## Jul-4-5501 (Miah/Elm Engagement)

Miah and Elm are now engaged to be married.

## Jul-12-5501 (Raid, Raareentium)

Raareentium is attacking with three pawns, two melee and one with a flintlock pistol.  One of them is aged 88 and has frail, bad back and alzheimer's.

## Jul-14-5501 (Sylvie/Red Fight)

Silvie gets into it with Red and Sylvie loses her nose.

## Sep-1-5501 (Miah/Elm Marriage)

Miah/Elm are now married.

## Sep-2-5501 (Raid, Hiuia Dynasty)

Raiders from Hiuia Dynasty.  

## Sep-3-5501 (Raid, Pollution Lineup)

A pair of melee-only enemies from Pollution Lineup.

## Sep-12-5501 (Sylvie Healed by Hornet)

Hornet was able to use the "Regrow Limbs" psycast under the Protector tree to regrow Sylvie's nose.  Sylvie gets knocked out for 24 hours and put into a healing coma.

## Dec-2-5501 (Raid, Red Lake People)

Raid by The Red Lake People.  Looks like a single mech also spawned in.

## Dec-7-5501 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  Beautiful this year, but Sylvie and Red got into a fist fight at the end.  We still got visitors from Central Republic to show up.

## Dec-11-5501 (Raid, Stladio Dynasty)

Stladio Dynasty is raiding with four pawns.  Followed by the first of two Nicole's Tomahawks raids that we agreed to as a favor to the empire.  One of the NT's party is a psycaster with good armor and a biocoded pulse rifle with range 31. Fortunately, they picked a fight with each other and also made a bear mad who joined in.

The other raiders from Nicole's Tomahawks showed up the next day.  All melee pawns.

## Dec-15-5501 (Elm Psycaster)

Elm has linked to the anima tree and starts the Protector tree for more doctors with healing psycasts.

# 5502

## Apr-7-5502 (Raid, Black Goblins)

Small raid by Black Goblins with shotguns.

Miah gets linked to the anima tree to become a psycaster.  

Slaver from Gray Owl Clan is attacking.

## Jul-12 (Khaled Joins)

Khaled, a 12yo boy, is begging to join us as he is being chased by some threat.  He has the desensitized trait and a burning passion for shooting.  Regular passion for cooking and animals.

Turns out we have to caravan to destroy a nearby sun blocker machine.  It's about a day away, but we'll allow for seven days.  Green, Abere, Hornet and Senga will be going.

## Sep-2-5502 (Raid, White Crag Bandits)

Four attackers from The White Crag Bandits with short-ranged gunpowder weapons.

## Sep-15-5502 (Khaled Adulthood)

Khaled is now age 13.  He picked up a passion for crafting and also the gourmand trait (a mixed blessing).  He immediately gets linked to the anima tree, but converting him to our ideology is going to take a while.  Going to run him down the Wildspeaker psycast tree like with Miah.

## Dec-2-5502 (Raid, Raareentium)

Raareentium is attacking with five pawns.  One has a rolling block rifle which we'll want to get if possible.  The north pair of raiders got beset by a pack of five militor mechanoids.  

## Dec-7-5502 (Primeval Jubilee, 1st Reformation)

Primeval Jubilee. It was "unforgettable" giving us enough points for our first reformation.  We'll pickup the Collectivist meme to go with Emancipation.  We'll add a Symbol Burning party.  Then go for the overpowered Immunity:Enhanced and Psyfocus Gain:Doubled precepts.

# 5503

## Apr-3-5503 (Purple Event, Psychic Bloom)

A psychic bloom has started.

## Jul-2-5503 (Sapling Child)

It turns out that Elm (F35, poluxkin) can still get pregnant by Miah even though they were set to 25% of normal chance.  Now we have a planted sapling child in the main garden area.

## Jul-2-5503 (Raid, Raareentium)

Raareentium is attacking with six pawns.  Longest range weapon is a musket.

## Jul-4-5503 (Raid, Nicole's Tomahawks)

Nicole's Tomahawks are attacking with three pawns.  One of them has a smoke launcher that we'll want to capture.

## Jul-15-5503 (Katten Joins)

We rescued Katten Wreford (F34, highmate) from a shuttle crash and she has decided to stay with us.  She has brawler and nimble, but is incapable of violence.  She has kind and distressed and the latter disables her bloodlust trait.  She's also incapable of caring duties.  Social is at 17 and a normal passion.  Intellectual is a burning passion.  We're going to call her by her first name of Katten.

Her meditation focus type is artistic.  Not sure we'll be able to turn her into a psycaster using the anima tree, but we'll try.  She was an easy convert to Primitive Creed (our ideology).  But Katten can't hold a conversion staff, so I'm not sure what psycaster tree I'll put her down.

Update: Even after conversion to our ideology, she can't be promoted to a psycaster using the anima tree.  That leaves buying/finding a psylink neuroformer or buttering up the shattered empire for a title.

## Sep-8-5503 (Katten/Miah Affair)

Well, let that be a lesson.  Never bring a highmate into the colony if you don't have multiple possible suitors of the opposite sex.  Katten is now having an affair with Miah and they've already psychically bonded.

And now Katten is pregnant.

## Sep-13-5503

A cold snap killed Elm's planted saplingchild.

## Sep-15-5503 (Raid, Purple Sound Settlement)

Three raiders from The Purple Sound Settlement are attacking.  At least one of them used a drop pod to arrive in the eastern half of the map.

## Dec-2-5503 (Royal Tribue Collector)

Our first visit by a Royal Tribute Collector.

## Dec-6-5503 (Khalid Diplomatic Marriage)

We're going to boot Khaled out because he's proving impossible to convert to our ideology.  We have a diplomatic marriage proposal from Hiuia Dynasty.

## Dec-7-5503 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  

## Dec-13-5503 (Katten Death, Katten Birth)

Katten has gone into labor and Elm has the best doctoring skill to be the attending.  Katten dies! She had such a sudden labor that she never made it to the steel hospital bed.  The baby is a healthy baby girl who we shall name Katten.  It remains to be seen if Miah will go insane from the breaking of the psychic bond.  He already has -10 for 20 days from his friend (Katten) dying, another -18 for 30 days due to her being his best friend and -25 for 30 days due to the psychic bond breaking.  On the other hand he's still married to Elm, so they'll both get the "got some loving" mood on the regular.

Three pawn raid from Red Lake People.  Miah will use "Summon Pack".  

# 5504

## Apr-9-5504

I'm going to give the good-quality Gauss Lance (45rng 40dmg) to Hornet with her burning passion for shooting, level 15 skill and the sharpshooting expertise.  She's one of the main doctors and sticks close to home so the movement penalty of -0.08 should be okay.  It has a really long 3.50s ranged cooldown and aiming time of 5.5s.

Green gets the rolling-block rifle, once she improves it to good-quality (40rng 21dmg).  She also has the sharpshooting expertise and 15 in shooting.

That leaves me with a pair of bolt-action rifles.  Those will be for Abere and Red.

## Apr-11-5504 (Miah's Mood)

Miah's mood starts to drop a bit.  Senga can cast "Counsel" due to her position as the Medicine Man.  That gives +18 for 16 days.  Which offsets one of the negative mood debuffs which ends around 16 days from now.

## Jul-4-5504 (Khai Joins)

A three year old child named Charlotte 'Khai' Denakhai is joining us but is being chased by unknown threats.  She's a baseliner and has no traits, incapabilities or passions.  Young children are usually an automatic approval for joining since they can be easily imprinted into the colony.  Her downside is being artistic for the mediatation type which puts her in the same problem as other pawns where you need a psylink neuroformer or level up with the shattered empire for a title.

(There is a mod that I could install that adds a tree-critter that allows you to eventually craft a psylink neuroformer.)

## Jul-9-5504 (Raid, Shadow Darts)

Two raiders from The Shadow Darts have shown up.  But while I think they are chasing Khai, they are also being chased by a pikeman mech.  Hornet should be able to outrange, but we'll also grab the smoke launcher.

No need for smoke, the two raiders killed the needler.  

## Jul-11-5504 (Raid, Shadow Darts)

Another Shadow Darts raid, this is the group hunting Khai.  It's a larger raid, so Miah is going to summon animals to thin them out.  It's not a fair fight given what was summoned (rhino, dark vandal, timber wolf, plus half a dozen other smaller critters).

## Sep-11-5504 (Raid, Stladio Dynasty)

Stladio Dynasty is attacking.  They spawned in next to a pair of pikeman mechs.

## Sep-12-5504 (Katten, Age 3)

Katten has reached age three.

## Dec-4-5504 (Raid, Red Lake People)

The Red Lake People are attacking.  

## Dec-5-5504 (Raid, Gray Owl Clan)

A single slaver from Gray Owl Clan is attacking.

## Dec-7-5504 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  Sylvia/Senga get into a fist fight.

## Dec-10-5504 (Raid, Gray Owl Clan)

Pillager raid by Gray Owl Clan.  

# 5505

## Apr-9-5505 (Khai, Age 7)

Khai has reached age 7 and picked up the jogger trait and a passion for artistic.

## Apr-13-5505 (Fungoid Ship)

A fungoid ship has landed.

Elm picks up the early bird trait (as a result of a breakdown caused by her anxious trait).

## Apr-14-5505

Sylvie picks up the cat person trait from fighting off the plague.

## Jul-8-5505 (Raid, Black Goblins)

Once again, Miha summons a pack of animals to clear out the raiders from Black Goblins.

## Sep-2-5505 (Refugees)

Six desperate refugees, Aurel and five children want shelter.  He was banished from his town and wants to stay with us for five days.

## Sep-3-5505 (Raid, Marcancan Nation)

Three humans from Marcancan Nation are attacking.

I used an animal pulse to trigger the two wandering thrumbo to attack the raiders, but two of our animals got caught in it.  Justus, our bonobo, had to be put down.  Ruby the lioness has been downed but not killed.  So we might save her.  Aurel got mauled but should live.

## Sep-5-5505 (Raid, Purple Sound Settlement)

Purple Sound Settlement is back.

## Sep-7-5505 (Hyosh Joins)

Hyosh (M6, gwennin) wants to join us.  He is one of the five children from the refugees quest. The other refugees have chosen to leave.

## Sep-10-5505 (Raid, Mil'Lampan Pact)

Mil'Lampan Pact is attacking with five pawns and they ran into three travelers from Red Cove Settlement.

## Sep-12-5505 (Katten, Age 7)

Katten has reached age 7.  She also picks up the jogger trait.  Passions for shooting, cooking and plants.

## Sep-13-5505 (Raid, Nicole's Tomahawks)

Four raiders from Nicole's Tomahawks.  

## Dec-1-5505 (Rock Constructs)

We now have six little rock constructs wandering around.  They were constructed by Green and Abere to help with hauling duties.  Each one active uses up 20 heat for the caster for the duration.  The spell is part of the Technomancer psycast path.  Wild or manhunting animals seem to ignore them, so I have them unrestricted to cover the entire map.  This hauling will free up Elm and Abere to focus more on research.

## Dec-4-5505 (Hyosh, Age 7)

Hyosh has reached age 7 and picked up the cat person trait.  But his learning was stunted and he picked up no passions as he was with us for only 15 days before hitting age 7.

## Dec-7-5505 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee. 

## Dec-8-5505 (Raid, Virus Crew)

Five wasters armed with tox grenades.  Summon the pack!

## Dec-9-5505 (Khai, Age 10)

## Dec-10-5505 (Raid, Nicole's Tomahawks, Psycaster)

Five raiders from Nicole's Tomahawks.  Including a level 4 psycaster.  But mechs also spawned in with three scorchers and one pikeman.

## Apr-6-5506 (Merchant Caravans)

Hopefully this is the start of a bunch of caravans visiting us.

- Apr 6th: War merchant from Aka's Clan.  Bought (2) female and (2) male megasloth.  Got rid of dozens and dozens of dropped raider weapons and 600 herbal medicine.

## Apr-7-5506 (Pack Animals)

Tamed a megalochelys (M15) which is a very large turtle.  It has 338 pack animal capacity and consumes 0.48/day nutrition.  They're only good for temps in the range -35C to +40C.

For the megasloths, I'm going to keep 2 adult male and 2 adult female.  Each consumes 1.6/day nutrition.  They're not suitable for pack animals on caravans.  That makes them mostly useful for food / textiles / leather.  I might ditch them for muffalo later.

## Apr-12-5506 (More Pack Animals)

A pair of male platybelodons have entered the map.  These are elephant like pack animals with 338 carrying capacity but at the cost of 2.48/day nutrition.  They're comfortable at -35C to +40C like the megalochelys.  I'm pretty sure I'll be culling these once I get muffalo.  Assuming they can carry 38kg of kibble and/or silage, that's 2500 units (15g/unit) or 125 nutrition.  So they can carry about 50 days of nutrition while still having plenty of cargo room (158kg capacity).  And if I caravan during the growing season that goes up to about 150-160 days of animal feed.

For humans they consume 1.6/day nutrition, so I need to pack about 80 nutrition per pawn to have 50 days (before foraging).  Given that the pemmican and hard tack will probably expire after 50 days this gives an upper limit on caravan distance.  That's 1600 hard tack at 18g each for a total of about 29kg.  For pemmican (modded) it would be 100 units at 0.29kg/unit which is 29kg.  Smoke meat (1600 units) would be slightly heavier, but not by much.  Humans can usually carry 35kg, so you really need pack animals of some type to carry the trade goods.

Caravan Checklist:

- Food (pemmican, hard tack, smoked meat)
- Medicine (5 per pawn)
- Bed rolls (1 per pawn)
