# 5500

## Apr-1-5500

The gods were angry.  We've escaped with what we could and have found a cirque to hole up in.  The main starter building is situated near (3) geysers which we can use to grow indoor crops.

Looking at the map we have a few friendly/neutral neighbors:

- Stonehurst (South Itin)
- Devotion's Rock (Treaty of Hatveor)
- Gray Cove (Caquexada Kinship)
- Omeithan Hold (Wasverler)
- Omehen (Eainor Nation)
- Easnor (The Purple Empire)
- Menand (Aka's Clan)
- Velia Castle (Andunera)

I use the word "close" loosely.  The empire is 15 days away in good weather, closer to 30 in bad weather.  Our closest neighbor is 7-8 days away in good conditions.

## Apr-4-5500 (Raid, Pollution Lineup)

Single pawn raider from Pollution Lineup.

## Apr-5-5500 (Animal Plague)

Dudley has the animal plague.

## Apr-9-5500 (Senga, Freeholder)

## Jul-9-5500 (Abere Psycaster)

Abere becomes a psycaster and she'll go down the Technomancer tree so that we can get rock construct haulers up and running.

## Jul-10-5500 (Senga: Yeoman)

Senga summons the bestower and gets her Yeoman rank.  The bestower is named Kyros Melodus (M65, baseliner).  Senga gets to psycaster level two and goes down the Empath tree.

An imperial shuttle crashes nearby with 1 passenger and two guards.  Naturally, the guards got into a fist fight as soon as they landed.

## Jul-15-5500 (Sylvie: Psycaster)

Sylvie links with the tree to start down the Protector branch.

Dudley has the animal flu.

## Sep-1-5500 (Magnolia Joins)

Magnolia (F82, animakin) has been granted refuge.  She has the cannibal, world weary, and body modder traits.  A burning passion for crafting and a regular passion for plants (skill 20).  The downside is her age (life expectancy is 80) which means she'll probably die in the first few years.  But in the meantime she can work the fields and trigger the anima tree mood pulse every 15 days.

## Sep-3-5500 (Slavers: Gray Owl Clan)

Slavers from GOC.  

## Dec-8-5500 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee. Beautiful, giving us +10 with South Itin (SI) and bringing visitors from Eastern Republic (ER).

## Dec-11-5500 (Plague)

Three colonists have the plague: Green, Red, Sylvie

## Dec-14-5500 (Raid: Southwest Seeremebum)

Southwest Seeremebum (SWS or SWSeer) is back for more.  They decided to play with a bear on the way in.  Two are dead and the third person is feeling.

# 5501

## Apr-1-5501 (Raid: Stladio Dynasty)

Stladio Dynasty (SD) is attacking.  They downed 2 of our 4 rock constructs.  But the rock constructs served as distractions while we volleyed arrows.

## Apr-6-5501 (Pillagers: Gray Owl Clan)

Pillages from Gray Owl Clan (GOC).

## Jul-11-5501 (Raid: Southwest Seeremebum)

Southwest Seeremebum is attacking.  

## Sep-9-5501 (Raid: Pollution Lineup)

Pollution Lineup (PL) is attacking.  Magnolia is killed during the combat by two shots from a bolt-action rifle.  On the plus side, we gained a pair of bolt-action rifles which can be improved by Green and Abere to good quality rifles.

## Sep-11-5501 (Pod Capture: Damien)

A pawn from our enemy, White Crag Bandits (WCB), has crashed in a pod nearby.  His name is Damien Budimcic (M14, baseliner).  He has the great memory trait and was a medical prodigy in his childhood.  He has burning passions for medical and intellectual.  Regular passions for plants and animals.  But artistic meditation, so we'll have to make him a yeoman with the empire to get started on psycasting.

## Sep-12-5501 (Raid: Cangorador Union)

Cangorador Union (CU) is attacking.  

## Dec-8-5501 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee. Unforgettable, giving us +20 with South Itin (SI).

Raid by Raareetium.  One is a psycaster.  

## Dec-13-5501 (Caravan: Black Crag Settlement)

Combat supplier from Black Crag Settlement (BCS).

Damien has agreed to join us.  It took 17 days.  He's going to be a dedicated researcher.

# 5502

## Apr-3-5502 (Yeoman Hosting)

We've agreed to host an imperial yeoman for 18 days in order to get Damien his yeoman title (and psycast unlock).

## Apr-5-5502 (Raid: Wakwanya Family)

Wakwanya Family (WF) is attacking.

## Apr-11-5502 (Cecropia Pod Crash)

Another animakin named Cecropia Wenge (F49) has crashed nearby.  She belongs to South Itin (but is willing to join) and suffers from paralytic abasia (30d) and caffiene addiction (24%).  She has the coward and gastronomist traits, which is fine as she'll stay behind the front lines if she joins as a wildspeaker.  A critical passion for social and burning passion for cooking.  Regular passions for plants and artistic.  The hard part will be converting her to our ideology.

## Apr-15-5502 (Cold Snap)

A cold snap during our growing season kills most of the outdoor crops.

## Jul-9-5502 (Raid: Hiuia Dynasty)

Hiuia Dynasty (HD) is attacking.  They spawned in fighting two pickmen and a militor.

## Jul-10-5502 (Yeoman: Damien)

Damien has reached enough honor to be a Yeoman.  That unlocks psycasts, but he can't become a wildspeaker since he only has artistic meditation.  But since he's an imperial, we can put him down the archon tree.

## Sep-11-5502 (Skirata Converts)

We captured Skirata (F23, lapis) from a shuttle crash.  They're in the prison until they convert and then join us.  Lapis xenotypes are unusual in that they consume minerals (rock chunks? metal chunks? steel?) instead of food.  With a burning passion for melee and mining and the great memory trait.  They should make a powerful melee pawn.

## Sep-12-5502 (Royal Tribute Collector)

Royal Tribute Collector, but we have no need of them at the moment.

## Dec-1-5502 (Skirata Joins)

As soon as Damien learned Word of Trust, he used it on Skirata and then Senga recruited her.  Plus a Word of Joy on Skirata by Senga to bring her mood up.  Looks like Skirata wants to consume steel to fill her her minerals meter.

## Dec-6-5502 (Slavers: Gray Owl Clan)

Gray Owl Clan (GOC) slavers are attacking.  Two melee pawns and a dog.  We captured Holme 'Thykeson' of Crow Clan (M45, baseliner).  He has the natural meditation but is a dunce and ascetic.  His burning passion for plants sort of salvages him, but he'll be a melee.

## Dec-8-5501 (Primeval Jubilee, 1st Reformation)

Primeval Jubilee. Unforgettable, giving us +20 with South Itin (SI).

Doing our first reformation.  Picking up cultured as our 2nd precept.  For precepts, we'll add Immunity:Enhanced and Marriage Name:Usually Woman's and Meditation:Exquisite.

## Dec-11-5502 (Flu: Four Colonists)

Four have the flu: Skirata, Abere, Green and Hornet.

## Dec-15-5502 (Raid: Marcancan Nation)

Raiders from Marcancan Nation (MCCN).  They spawned in chased by a pair of scythers.

We captured Gray Levego (M38, baseliner) who has the nimble trait.  Burning passions for cooking and plants.  Has natural focus.  

# 5503

## Apr-3-5503 (Raid: Gray Owl Clan)

GOC is raiding with two melee pawns.  That was easy, but while rearming traps, Red lost her left leg.  Fortunately Hornet was at hand to tend and rescue.  Hornet has the Regrow Limbs psycast, so Red will take a nap once she's back inside the walls.

## Apr-5-5503 (Raid: Shadow Darts)

Shadow Darts (SD) is attacking.  Levago is converted and recruited to our colony.

## Apr-14-5503 (Raid: Camel Men)

Camel Men (CM) is attacking.  These are higher technology attackers.  EM Marksman Rifle and Gauss Rifle could be ours.  The other two pawns have biocoded spacer weapons.  Cecropia sneaks out on the south side and casts a manhunter pulse to make every animal in a large area very mad.  Two moose (meese?), the animalisk, nine wild boar and a few squirrels.   It was enough to kill the enemy, but the death acidifiers melted the weapons that we wanted.

## Jul-1-5503 (Raid: Lertroga Pack)

Lertroga Pack (LP) are attacking.  Cecropia snuck out and made the muffalo herd mad to deal with the invaders, which also gives us more meat/fur for the storage area.  We captured Caican, but we need to remove her left leg as she has a peg leg.  If she lives and once she has converted, we'll regrow it for her.

She's already converted while still in the prison hospital bed and Damien has already reduced her resistance to joining us.

Caican (F41, baseliner) has the teetotaler trait.  A critical passion for animals, burning passion for crafting and a normal passion for intellectual.  She does have a high shooting skill, but also a high loss rate.  

## Jul-2-5503 (Senga/Gray Lovers)

Senga (F27, baseliner) and Gray Levego (M38, baseliner) are now lovers.  We'll have Gray go by his first name instead of Levago.

## Jul-3-5503 (Caican Joins)

Caican survived her surgery and is now a colonist resting in the proper hospital.

And Senga gets pregnant on their first night.

Cecropia now has the Summon Pack ability.  With her current sensitivity of 190% that summons a pack of power 1520.  I'm not sure if that's "raid power", but it might be.  She has two more skills to unlock in the Wildspeaker tree and then she'll focus on Empath to go with her critical passion for social.  I debated Archon, but she's going to spend most raids resting after summoning the animal pack.

## Jul-8-5503 (Raid: Pact of Neve)

Pact of Neve has come to play.  Crecropia will summon an animal pack to play with them.

## Jul-12-5503 (Trader: Andunera)

Weaponsmith trader from Andunera.

## Sep-3-5503 (Senga/Gray Engagement)

Senga/Gray are now engaged.

## Sep-8-5503 (Empire Titles)

- Senga: Praetor
- Damien: Acolyte

But I'm not sure why their titles increased.

Gray Owl Clan is raiding, but chased by a maddened cougar.  Oh, two cougars versus the single pawn from GOC.

## Sep-9-5503 (Peza Born)

Senga (F28) gives birth to Gray's (M39) child under a blood moon.  The baby boy will be named Peza, but was born sick.  Fortunately we have modern medicine to treat him with.

Followed by a yttakin raid (Wakwanya Family) which we'll deal with via a summoned pack.

We'll agree to guard someone for a day from Eastern Republic in exchange for an intellectual skill trainer.  The White Crag Bandits (WCB) shows up a few hours later.  Some of our animal pack from earlier is still summoned, but we may have to fight directly.  We fought them off and captured Ollart (F43).

We still need to regrow Caican's leg.  Once she's healed up from her social fight, we'll do that.

Abere gets to use the intellectual skill trainer, taking her from 11 to 15.  She has the burning passion for it.  That also gives her the level needed to go for specialization in research speed.

Peza has recovered from the infant illness.

## Sep-11-5503 (Anima Collosus Breeding Pair)

Well, this could be fun.  A pair of anima collossus have wandered onto the map and joined the colony.  They require handling skill 9, only eat 0.65/day and are a breeding pair.  

## Sep-12-5509 (Cougars Join)

A trio of female cougars have joined as well.  We'll put them down in the barn area with the collosus.  Eh, on second thought we'll just slaughter them.  It's too early to have a full barn of animals.  I'm only keeping the collosus because of how rare they are.

## Sep-14-5509 (Thykeson/Green Lovers)

Thykeson (M46) and Green (F32) are now lovers.

A female timber wolf has joined.

## Dec-1-5503 (Raid: Pollution Lineup)

PL is raiding.  Time for Caican to summon her first pack. Her pack power is only 800 compared to Crecropia's 1520.

Followed by the Royal Tribute Collector.

## Dec-3-5503 (Ollart Joins)

Ollart (F43, baseliner) has joined.  She has the body purist and trigger happy traits.  Burning passion for medical, regular passions for artistic and social, but only the artistic mediation type.

## Dec-8-5503 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee. Terrible quality.

## Dec-9-5503 (Damien/Skirata Lovers)

Damien and Skirata are now lovers.  Their kids are going to be interesting as Skirata is a lapis.

Pillagers from Gray Owl Clan.  Summon the animal pack!

## Dec-10-5503 (Senga/Gray Marriage)

Senga and Gray have married.

## Dec-11-5503 (Anima Collosus Birth)

The female anima collosus has given birth.

## Dec-15-5503 (Archon Raid during Psychic Storm)

A psychic storm is occuring and it has spawned in an archon raider.  They have 460% psychic sensitivity (but only psylink 1) due to the storm and a big archoblade sword.

We were able to down Thorvark Viththra with a Word of Pain and now let's see if we can convert her.  Age 30 with quick sleeper and psychopath traits. Burning passions for social and crafting.  Regular passions for cooking and planting.  Baseline sensitivy is 210% due to genes and the biocoded archoplate.  The downside is that they *will* respond to social insults with a social fight and use their melee weapon to prove their point (extremely aggressive gene).

# 5504

## Apr-1-5504 (Skirata Pregnancy)

Skirata (F24, lapis) is pregnant with Damien's (M19, baseline) child.  The baby picked up about half of Skirata's genes.  But not ones like foodless, reactive armor, or mineral shock.

## Apr-3-5504 (Green Rejected Thykeson's Proposal)

Green rejected Thykeson's proposal of marriage.

## Apr-4-5504 (Raid: Mil'Lampan Pact)

Mil'Lampan Pact (MLP) called us up yesterday with an extortion demand and we refused.  Today they are attacking.  I think we have (3) drop pods to deal with.  Two are inside the walls.  Gren lost a few toes, but we can regrow those.

## Apr-7-5504 (Viththra Joins)

Viththra, our very volatile archon has joined.  I think we'll shorten her nickname to just 'Vithra'.  She will not be allowed to carry her blade unless drafted.

## Apr-9-5504 (Green Pregnancy)

Green (F32, baseliner) is pregnant with Thykeson's (M46, baseliner) child.  

## Apr-11-5504 (Damien/Skirata Engagement)

Damien/Skirata are now engaged.

Raid by Verthiwitium (VTWM).  Caican summons an animal pack to deal with the four raiders. We captured two of them:

- Suero (F51, baseliner): Tough trait. Burning passion for melee and plants.  Normal passion for shooting and mining.
- Ail (F53, baseliner): Hard worker trait.  Burning passion for intellectual.  Normal passion for crafting. 

Ail will probably convert to our ideology first.  Which means she'll get out of prison first.

Cleo, our female anima collosus, is pregnant again.  I must have missed her 2nd pregnancy as there are now four of them in the barnyard.  Will name the 2nd one, Elsie.  Her brother is Napa.

## Apr-14-5504 (Ail Joins)

Ail has converted and been recruited.

## Apr-15-5504 (Raid; SWSeer, Psycaster)

SWSeer is raiding, with a psycaster.  That means Caican will summon a pack.  Picked up all sorts of goodies including a pair of semi-automatic rifles and a gauss rifle.

Captured Peeraer (F20, baseliner) with the super-immune trait.  Burning passion for melee and cooking, regular passion for mining.

Suero will join soon now that she's been converted and her resistance is broken.

## Jul-1-5504 (Suero Joins)

Vithra did the honors to fulfill her inspiration.

## Jul-1-5504 (Green Rejected Thykeson's Proposal, Breakup)

Green rejected Thykeson's proposal of marriage.  The two are no longer in a relationship.

## Jul-2-5504 (Royal Tribute Collector)

Royal Tribute Collector is here, but we have no need.

Peeraer has converted to our ideology.  Recruitment starts tomorrow.

We're starting to crank through research with up to nine or ten pawns doing research.

## Jul-3-5504 (Peeraer Joins)

Peeraer joins and immediately gets put into a regeneration coma to regrow her right leg.

## Jul-5-5504 (Raid: Pigmoili)

Pigmoili is attacking.  One has a heavy SMG.

## Sep-8-5504 (Visitors)

Visitors from Great Unarith Forest (GUF).  I wonder how much we can give away to them.  Enough to get +97 goodwill it turns out!

## Sep-9-5504 (Shuttle Crash)

We rescued Janos (M15, baseliner) from a shuttle crash and he joined.  A critical passion for artistic, burning passion for shooting but the critical passion lowers the learning rate to 38%.  He has the careful shooter trait.  

## Sep-14-5504 (Raid: Hiuia Dynasty)

Hiuia Dynasty (HD) are attacking.  We're trying to capture Bitxilore Groeneveldt (F17, baseliner) who is in her second trimester of pregnancy.  She has the snob, super-immune, and trigger-happy traits.  A burning passion for medical and normal passions for melee, crafting, intellectual.

Raid by the Black Goblins followed shortly.  

## Dec-2-5504 (Groeneveldt Joins)

Groeneveldt joins.  We'll give her a shorter nickname of just Lion.

## Dec-7-5504 (Caravan Visitors)

Weaponsmith from Andunera.

## Dec-8-5504 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee. Unimpressive.

## Dec-9-5504 (Raid: Wakwanya Family)

Wakwanya Family (WF) are attacking.  They spawned in with (3) maddened wargs.

## Dec-11-5504 (X Born)

Lion (F18) gives birth to a girl named Cub.

Skirata (F25) goes into labor shortly thereafter with Damien (father) acting as the doctor.  She gives birth to a healthy baby boy named Ata.

A wanderer named Sana Aukema (F35, baseliner) has joined.  She has the tough, trigger-happy and wanderlust traits.  A critical passion for artistic and burning passion for medical.  Regular passions for mining and shooting.  She has the natural focus, but wanderers have about a 50-50 chance (based on my mod settings) to turn out as traitors.

Double raid - Gray Owl Clan and Black Hive attacking.

## Dec-14-5504 (Janos Converted, 2nd Reformation)

I forgot that Janos wasn't of our ideology.  Converting him gives enough points for our 2nd reformation.  Picking up the Healthcare precept.  That means I need to train up Lion in medical (to level 6) and make her the Nurse.

Jikazonss is attacking.  One is the husband of Ollart.
