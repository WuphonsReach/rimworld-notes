# 5500

## Apr-1-5500

The gods were angry.  We've escaped with what we could and have found a cirque to hole up in.  The main starter building is situated near (3) geysers which we can use to grow indoor crops.

Looking at the map we have a few friendly/neutral neighbors:

- Stonehurst (South Itin)
- Devotion's Rock (Treaty of Hatveor)
- Gray Cove (Caquexada Kinship)
- Omeithan Hold (Wasverler)
- Omehen (Eainor Nation)
- Easnor (The Purple Empire)
- Menand (Aka's Clan)
- Velia Castle (Andunera)

I use the word "close" loosely.  The empire is 15 days away in good weather, closer to 30 in bad weather.  Our closest neighbor is 7-8 days away in good conditions.

## Apr-4-5500 (Raid, Pollution Lineup)

Single pawn raider from Pollution Lineup.

## Apr-5-5500 (Animal Plague)

Dudley has the animal plague.

## Apr-6-5500 (Senga, Freeholder)

Senga becomes a freeholder by saving an imperial from a manhunting kitty.

## Apr-12-5500 (Cold Snap)

A cold snap kills all of our newly planted crops.

## Jul-1-5500 (Sylve/Red Social Fight)

Sylvie and Red are starting to develop a rivalry.

## Jul-5500 (Caravan Visitors)

- Jul 6th: Medieval war merchant from Coalition of Coro
- Jul 8th: Genetics supplier from Treat of Hatveor
- Jul 12th: Bulk goods trader from Eainor Nation
- Jul 13th: Bulk goods trader from Central Republic
- Jul 15th: Animal herder from Andunera
- Sep 4th: Combat supplier from Red Cove Settlement -- Marksman Rifle for Hornet, Bolt-action rifle for Green

## Jul-5-5500 (Raid, Fasytt Pack)

Raiders from Fasytt Pack.  

Senga becomes the Medicine Man.

## Jul-6-5500 (Hornet/Red Plague)

Hornet and Red are sick with the plague.

## Jul-7-5500 (Heat Wave)

It probably won't last long enough to extend the growing season, which is a shame.

Hornet picks up her first psycaster level.  She, like any of those with doctoring skill or interest, will be going down the protector tree first.

## Jul-13-5500 (Pillager Raid, Gray Owl Clan)

Pillagers from Gray Owl Clan.

## Jul-14-5500 (Raid, Virus Crew)

Raiders from Virus Crew.

## Sep-4-5500 (Hornet, 2nd Psycast)

Hornet gets Word of Immunity from the Protector path.

## Sep-8-5500 (Raid, White Crag Bandits)

Raid by White Crag Bandits.

## Sep-10-5500 (Hornet, Psycaster Level 4)

Hornet has gotten to 110% sensitivity and has Word of Healing and Word of Immunity.  I'll push her to 125% sensitivity and then get the two levels to unlock Regrow Limbs.  Then it's time to start in on Sylvie.

## Dec-4-5500 (Raiders, Fasytt Pack)

Raiders from Fasytt Pack.

## Dec-8-5500 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  Beautiful celebration so everyone gets +6 for six days.

# 5501

## Apr-1-5501 (Flu)

The year 5501 starts off with three tribespeople getting the flu: Green, Abere, Red.

## Apr-6-5501 (Sylvie Psycaster)

Sylvie gets linked at the anima tree, twice.  She picks up the Protector path and gains Word of Healing and Word of Immunity.

## Apr-8-5501 (Raid, Cangorador Union)

Raiders from Cangorador Union.

## Jul-2-5501 (Raid, Iserevela Accord)

Raiders from Iserevela Accord.  

Green picks up her psycaster pathway of Technomancer.

## Jul-7-5501 (Flu)

Hornet has the flu.  As does a prisoner that we are holding for the empire.

## Jul-15-5501 (Rock Constructs)

Green now has enough psycast levels in Technomancer to summon rock constructs for hauling.  Each consumes 20 neural heat but requires no feeding, no training, they can't get sick, they don't sleep, and they're pretty sturdy.  They'll also clean occasionally, which helps with the small amount of filth that they generate.  Green currently has enough heat capacity to keep two running.  Eventually she should be able to operate six to ten.

## Sep-4-5501 (Raid, Hiuia Dynasty)

Raiders from Hiuia Dynasty.  They decided to play with the rock constructs out in the field.  They knocked one unconscious but the 2nd one managed to kill one of the raiders and the other fled.

## Sep-13-5501 (Raid, Marcancan Nation)

Raiders from Marcancan Nation.

## Dec-8-5500 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  

Three timber wolves wander in and join.  One female and two males.

## Dec-12-5501 (Hail Joins)

Mihail 'Hail' Ritter (M18, baseliner) has joined us.  He was rescued from a shuttle crash.  He has the nimble and flirty traits.  With passions for animals, social intellectual and a critical passion for artistic.

Bluegum 'Larch' Larch (F15, animakin) is also joing us from the shuttle crash.  Has the tough and careful shooter traits, but no passion for shooting and a -8 to shooting from a gene.  Passions for crafting, plants and intellectual.  Incapable of social.  I'll still give her the lever action shotgun that we have.

Senga needs to equip the conversion staff and start to work on converting them to our ideology.  Larch is first because she is unhappy about our use of trees.

## Dec-14-5501 (Flu)

Flu has hit Sylvie and Abere.  Time to use Word of Immunity.

Raiders from Deadly Rats.

## Dec-15-5501 (Raid, Virus Crew)

The Virus Crew raiders are attacking.

## Jul-7-5502 (Raiders, Fasytt Pack)

Raiders from Fasytt Pack.

We captured Byyn Wyn'kottys (M20, gwennin) and recruited him as Hail had an inspiration.

## Jul-13-5502 (Raid, Red Lake People)

Raid by the Red Lake People.

## Sep-2-5502 (Mech Cluster)

Got a mech cluster inside the walls as part of an empire quest.  We built a bunker nearby and sniped the mobile attackers and most turrets without too much risk.  Nobody lost limbs or body parts or died.
