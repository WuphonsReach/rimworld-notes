# 5500

## Apr-1-5500

The gods were angry.  We've escaped with what we could and have found a cirque to hole up in.  The main starter building is situated near (3) geysers which we can use to grow indoor crops.

Looking at the map we have a few friendly/neutral neighbors:

- Stonehurst (South Itin)
- Devotion's Rock (Treaty of Hatveor)
- Gray Cove (Caquexada Kinship)
- Omeithan Hold (Wasverler)
- Omehen (Eainor Nation)
- Easnor (The Purple Empire)
- Menand (Aka's Clan)
- Velia Castle (Andunera)

I use the word "close" loosely.  The empire is 15 days away in good weather, closer to 30 in bad weather.  Our closest neighbor is 7-8 days away in good conditions.

## Apr-4-5500 (Raid, Pollution Lineup)

Single pawn raider from Pollution Lineup.

## Apr-5-5500 (Animal Plague)

Dudley has the animal plague.

## Apr-6-5500 (Senga, Freeholder)

Senga becomes a freeholder by saving an imperial from a manhunting kitty.

## Apr-12-5500 (Cold Snap)

A cold snap kills all of our newly planted crops.

## Jul-1-5500 (Sylve/Red Social Fight)

Sylvie and Red are starting to develop a rivalry.

## Jul-5500 (Caravan Visitors)

- Jul 3rd: Armorsmith from Wasverler
- Jul 3rd: Exotic goods trader from Black Crag Settlement
- Jul 4th: Genetics supplier from Rahini
- Jul 5th: War merchant from Great Unarith Forest
- Jul 6th: Medieval war merchant from Coalition of Coro
- Jul 8th: Genetics supplier from Treat of Hatveor
- Jul 12th: Bulk goods trader from Eainor Nation
- Jul 13th: Bulk goods trader from Central Republic
- Jul 15th: Animal herder from Andunera
- Sep 4th: Combat supplier from Red Cove Settlement -- Marksman Rifle for Hornet, Bolt-action rifle for Green

## Jul-5-5500 (Raid, Fasytt Pack)

Raiders from Fasytt Pack.  

Senga becomes the Medicine Man.

## Jul-6-5500 (Hornet/Red Plague)

Hornet and Red are sick with the plague.

## Jul-7-5500 (Heat Wave)

It probably won't last long enough to extend the growing season, which is a shame.

Hornet picks up her first psycaster level.  She, like any of those with doctoring skill or interest, will be going down the protector tree first.

## Jul-13-5500 (Pillager Raid, Gray Owl Clan)

Pillagers from Gray Owl Clan.

## Jul-14-5500 (Raid, Virus Crew)

Raiders from Virus Crew.

## Sep-4-5500 (Hornet, 2nd Psycast)

Hornet gets Word of Immunity from the Protector path.

## Sep-8-5500 (Raid, White Crag Bandits)

Raid by White Crag Bandits.

## Sep-10-5500 (Hornet, Psycaster Level 4)

Hornet has gotten to 110% sensitivity and has Word of Healing and Word of Immunity.  I'll push her to 125% sensitivity and then get the two levels to unlock Regrow Limbs.  Then it's time to start in on Sylvie.

## Dec-4-5500 (Raiders, Fasytt Pack)

Raiders from Fasytt Pack.

## Dec-8-5500 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  Beautiful celebration so everyone gets +6 for six days.

# 5501

## Apr-1-5501 (Flu)

The year 5501 starts off with three tribespeople getting the flu: Green, Abere, Red.

## Apr-6-5501 (Sylvie Psycaster)

Sylvie gets linked at the anima tree, twice.  She picks up the Protector path and gains Word of Healing and Word of Immunity.

## Apr-8-5501 (Raid, Cangorador Union)

Raiders from Cangorador Union.

## Jul-2-5501 (Raid, Iserevela Accord)

Raiders from Iserevela Accord.  

Green picks up her psycaster pathway of Technomancer.

## Jul-7-5501 (Flu)

Hornet has the flu.  As does a prisoner that we are holding for the empire.

## Jul-15-5501 (Rock Constructs)

Green now has enough psycast levels in Technomancer to summon rock constructs for hauling.  Each consumes 20 neural heat but requires no feeding, no training, they can't get sick, they don't sleep, and they're pretty sturdy.  They'll also clean occasionally, which helps with the small amount of filth that they generate.  Green currently has enough heat capacity to keep two running.  Eventually she should be able to operate six to ten.

## Sep-4-5501 (Raid, Hiuia Dynasty)

Raiders from Hiuia Dynasty.  They decided to play with the rock constructs out in the field.  They knocked one unconscious but the 2nd one managed to kill one of the raiders and the other fled.

## Sep-13-5501 (Raid, Marcancan Nation)

Raiders from Marcancan Nation.

## Dec-8-5500 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  

Three timber wolves wander in and join.  One female and two males.

## Dec-12-5501 (Hail Joins)

Mihail 'Hail' Ritter (M18, baseliner) has joined us.  He was rescued from a shuttle crash.  He has the nimble and flirty traits.  With passions for animals, social intellectual and a critical passion for artistic.

Bluegum 'Larch' Larch (F15, animakin) is also joing us from the shuttle crash.  Has the tough and careful shooter traits, but no passion for shooting and a -8 to shooting from a gene.  Passions for crafting, plants and intellectual.  Incapable of social.  I'll still give her the lever action shotgun that we have.

Senga needs to equip the conversion staff and start to work on converting them to our ideology.  Larch is first because she is unhappy about our use of trees.

Some of the timber wolves have the flu.

Vikings from Gray Owl Clan are attacking.

We've recruited Beinkt 'Ink' Gapson (M46, baseliner) who has ascetic, brawler, psychopath traits.  Regular passions for melee, animals and intellectual.

# 5503

## Apr-8-5503 (Selena Joins)

A crashed prisoner has joined named Selena (F43, baseliner).  She has pyromaniac, fast walker, academian traits.  Incapable of social or cooking.  Burning passions for construction, crafting and medical.  A normal passion for intellectual.

Lots of the wolves have the flu, including a pair of bonded.

## Jul-10-5503 (Hail/Abere Lovers)

Hail (M20, baseliner) and Abere (F22, baseliner) are now lovers.

## Sep-2-5503 (Black Hive, Raid)

Raiders from Purple Pound Settlement are attacking at the same time as a Black Hive raid.

## Sep-5-5503 (Ding Joins)

Ding (F31, baseliner) has joined.  She was captured from one of the recent raids and converted to our ideology *before* recruitment attempts.  She has the nimble and fast walker traits, with no downsides.  Passions for cooking, animals and social.  But no burning passions.

## Sep-6-5503 (Val Joins)

Our other captured pawn is Val (F14, genie).  She has the undergrounder, drunken master and nimble traits.  A burning passion for cooking.  Natural passions for crafting and intellectual.

## Sep-8-5503 (Ink Arrested, Abere Pregnancy)

Abere is pregnant.  We've arrested Ink and will lock him up until he converts to our ideology.  A similar fate awaits Larch and Selena.

## Dec-2-5503 (1st Reformation)

We'll pickup the Collectivist meme to go with Emancipation.  We'll add a Symbol Burning party and Festivals that give recruit chances.  Then go for the overpowered Immunity:Enhanced and Psyfocus Gain:Doubled precepts.  And move our annual festival to Apr 4th, right before planting season.

## Dec-6-5503 (Raid, Stladio Dynasty)

Decent sized raid by Stladio Dynasty, but also a pack of manhunter phoenix owlcats.  Those come with nine lives (literaly) so they are going to be respawning for a while.  Fortunately, you only need to kill them once to free them of the manhunting debuff.

Now they've started hunting each other for food.

## Dec-8-5503 (Purple: Ice Age Begins)

An ice age has started.  That means it's about to get a lot colder here and for a very long time.

## Dec-10-5503 (Prison Break)

Ink made a run for it.  Ding went berserk trying to arrest him and now three colonists are in the hospital.  Val lost a thumb, but we can regrow that.

## Dec-13-5503 (Rain Birth)

Hail (M21, baseliner) and Abere (F22, baseliner) gave birth to a baby boy named Trosma 'Rain' Coyote.

We've also worn Ink down to just 20% certainty in his old ideology.

# 5504

Spring is here.  The worst of the winter temperatures so far was -41C under the ice age event.  But in a previous run I've seen -55C so I need to continue to monitor the temperatures of the indoor crop areas.  We've laid by about 5500 charcoal, 1300 coal and 15,000 wood for keeping us warm.

## Apr-2-5504 (Prison Break, Ink)

Ink makes another break for freedom. He loses a pair of toes for his trouble.  We'll grow those back once he's released.

## Apr-4-5504 (Primeval Jubilee)

Hail/Abere are now engaged to be married.

Primeval Jubilee.  This now falls on the 4th of spring.  It was a beautiful ceremony.

Raid: Marcancan Nation.  One of them is the ex-husband of Red.

Senga is doing most of the work as the Medicine Man to convert Ink to our ideology.  She usually manages about a 9% loss of certainty with him every three days.  The other jailers will interact with him to keep it from creeping back up.  Plus he's in an awful jail cell with an awful-quality stone bed with no recreation.  We're down to just 2.5% certainty.

## Apr-5-5504 (Ink Converts, Selena Arrested)

Ink has finally converted to our ideology.  Now for the volatile Selena (a pyromaniac).

## Apr-8-5504 (Selena Converts)

Selena was an easy conversion.  Larch is next.

## Jul-1-5504 (Hail/Abere Marriage)

Hail/Abere got married.

## Jul-10-5504 (Raid: Verthiwitium)

Verthiwitium is attacking.

## Sep-2-5504 (Helm Chart)

The list of helms that we can make at this point in time at a fueled smithy (Steel):

| Name            | Metal | Work | Sharp | Blunt | Heat  | Bonuses / Notes                                  |
| --------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Simple Helmet   | 40    | 54   | 45.0% | 22.5% | 30.0% |                                                  |
| Ravager Helmet  | 40    | 54   | 37.8% | 18.9% | 25.2% | -8.0 shooting, +20% pain shock                   |
| Plate Helm      | 60    | 167  | 63.0% | 31.5% | 42.0% | -4.0 shooting, +20% pain shock                   |
| Morion Helm     | 50    | 150  | 54.0% | 27.0% | 36.0% |                                                  |
| Kettle Hat      | 50    | 150  | 54.0% | 27.0% | 36.0% |                                                  |
| Improved Helmet | 40+20 | 167  | 63.0% | 31.5% | 42.0% | Uses 20 plasteel                                 |
| Great Helm      | 70    | 200  | 63.0% | 31.5% | 42.0% | -8.0 shooting, +30% pain shock, -0.10 move speed |

The plate helm makes a lot of sense for melee.  Now, the helm doesn't make a whole lot of impact on the overall stats, but it's important for protecting the brain.

## Sep-5-5504 (Raid, Purple Sound Settlement)

Raiders from PSS.  They spawned in pursued by a pikeman mech.  

## Sep-6-5504 (Larch Converts)

Larch finally converts.  Lady (a captured pawn) has already converted.  It's time to let Larch out of prison.

The list of middle armor that we can make at a fueled smithy:

| Name                          | Mats | Work | Sharp | Blunt | Heat  | Bonuses / Notes             |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| Brest Plate (Steel)           | 70   | 234  | 58.5% | 29.3% | 39.0% |                             |
| Lamellar Armor (Steel)        | 140  | 417  | 54.0% | 27.0% | 36.0% | -0.20 move speed            |
| Lamellar Armor (Heavy Fur)    | 140  | 417  | 74.4% | 14.4% | 90.0% | -0.20 move speed            |
| Lamellar Armor (Pleanleather) | 140  | 417  | 48.6% | 14.4% | 90.0% | -0.20 move speed, 9.6C cold |
| Light Plate Mail (Steel)      | 130  | 500  | 58.5% | 29.3% | 39.0% | -0.10 move speed, 3.0C cold |

And the armor that can be made at a crafting spot / bench:

| Name                             | Leather | Work | Sharp | Blunt | Heat  | Bonuses / Notes |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------------- |
| Tribal Hide Armor (Heavy Fur)    | 50      | 50   | 43.4% | 8.4%  | 52.5% | 6.0C cold       |
| Tribal Hide Armor (Pleanleather) | 50      | 50   | 28.4% | 8.4%  | 52.5% | 3.2C cold       |

More advanced middle armor:

| Name                      | Mats | Work | Sharp | Blunt | Heat  | Bonuses / Notes                    |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| Legionnaire Armor (Steel) | 120  | 700  | 61.2% | 30.6% | 40.8% | -0.20 move speed, -5% mental break |
| Centurion Armor (Steel)   | 140  | 734  | 65.7% | 32.9% | 43.8% | -0.25 move speed                   |

So the Brest Plate (Steel) is a pretty good choice.  

## Sep-8-5504 (Lady Joins)

Lady has joined us.  She is age 21 and a baseliner.  Her trait is too smart.  Burning passion for social and regular passions for plants and intellectual.

## Sep-13-5504 (Rain Childhood)

Rain attains age 3 and becomes a child.

Raid, Virus Crew.

It hits -51C tonight.

## Dec-6-5504 (Muscle Parasites)

Four colonists have muscle parasites.  I think we have to treat this with normal medicine and using psypowers won't help.

It hit a low of -58C overnight.

## Dec-8-5504 (Ice Age Year One)

We've used up about 1/4 of our wood supply so far in one year.  The amount of nutrition is holding steady thanks to a supply of meat-on-the-move (wildlife) and the mushroom farms.  Still have 5500 charcoal and 1300 coal for heat.  But we'll probably have to enclose another steam geyser and start growing wood mushrooms.

It's bottomed out at a low of -60C so far.

## Dec-11-5504 (Kon Joins)

We rescued Kon (F32, prole) from a shuttle crash.  She is iron-willed but a slow learner and incapable of dumb labor.  Her critical passion for plants makes her an extra-slow learner for combat skills.  But she has passions for construction, cooking and animals.  

## Dec-12-5504 (Raid: Cangorador Union)

The CU are attacking in -44C weather.  Senga summons a pack of animals to deal with the situation.

## Dec-14-5504 (Raid: Jikazonss)

Imps from Jikazonss are attacking.  

Abere is pregnant again.

# 5505

## Apr-4-5505 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  It was beautiful.

## Apr-5-5505 (Fibrous Mechanites)

Thanks Randy, four colonists eating into our medicine supply.

## Apr-15-5505 (Animal Plague)

Three of the named wolves have the plague.

## Jul-4-5505 (Fog Birth, Ice Age Ends)

Abere enters labor.  A healthy baby boy that we'll name Breixos 'Fog' Ritter.

The planters have decided that it may stay warm enough for a rice crop during the ice age.  It's staying above freezing at night.  Oh, the ice age ended after about 1.5 years.

Seven colonists have caught the plague.  Val gets the worst of it because of his geneline, genie.  Green picks up the wimp trait.

## Jul-9-5505 (Dek Joins)

Benedek 'Dek' The Terrific (M39, baseliner) has been recruited.  He has the tortured artist, super-immune and psychically hypersensitive traits.  Sadly, he doesn't have natural meditation so it will be difficult to make him into a psycaster.  Burning passions for crafting and artistic.  Regular passion for animals.

## Jul-12-5505 (Fungoid Ship)

Fungoid ship chunk crashes outside the wall/marsh area.  We'll have to build a quick bunker to combat it.

## Sep-1-5505 (Raid: Pollution Lineup)

PL is attacking.  We'll just summon a pack to take care of it.

## Sep-3-5505 (Raid: Nicole's Tomahawks)

NT is attacking.  

## Sep-5-5505 (Raid: Gray Owl Clan)

GOC is attacking.

FYI: We have (16) rock constructs for hauling and (9) steel constructs for defense.

## Sep-12-5505 (Trade Caravans for 5505)

- Sep 12th: Bulk goods trader from Treaty of Hatveor (ToH) -- got to +95 goodwill
- Dec 14th: Shaman merchant from Tromsa Confederacy (TC)

## Sep-13-5505 (Rain, Age 7)

Rain reaches age 7.  He picks up shooting and medical and the too smart trait.

## Sep-14-5505 (Melee Weapons)

Low-technology melee weapons which can be crafted at the fueled smithy with just neolithic technologies.  Stats are for steel unless noted and normal quality.

## Sep-15-5505 (Raid: SW Seer w/ Psycaster)

SW Seer is attacking with a psycaster.  Level 9 and dressed in heavy armor (deserter armor).  Another enemy has a rolling block rifle, which we like.  But that pawn escaped when the assault failed.

## Dec-1-5505 (Plague)

Plague strikes four of our pawns.  Including the baby, Fog.  Selena picks up the clumsy trait due to the illness.

Ding (F33, baseliner) and Dek (M40, baseliner) are now lovers.

## Dec-2-5505 (Raid, Raareetium)

Raareetium (RRT) is raiding with six pawns.

## Dec-8-5505 (Purple Empire Quest)

We're going to accept a quest from Purple Empire where we assault a camp with 4 deserters.  We have to send 7 soldiers and the empire will supply 6 soldiers.  One of the rewards is the "Freeholder of Babrin" title which would give +1 honor every 5 days to Senga whenever she is at home.  That's a huge amount of honor that could stack up over time.

## Dec-13-5505 (Dek/Ding Engagement)

Dek and Ding are engaged.

# 5506

## Apr-4-5506 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  Unforgettable.

Fog reaches age 3.  That means Abere can go into the body shop (regeneration coma) to get her torso scar fixed up.

## Apr-5-5506 (Raid: Pigmoili)

Pigmoili is attacking.  One has a heavy SMG.  We'll give it to Abere.

## Apr-11-5506 (Dek/Ding Marriage)

Dek/Ding got married.  

## Jul-8-5506 (Raid, Pigs)

The pigs are back.  Lost our rottweiler, Dobri.

## Jul-11-5506 (Ding Pregnancy)

Ding (F34, baseliner) is pregnant with Dek's (M40, baseliner) child.

## Jul-13-5506 (Rain, Age 10)

Rain reached the age of 10.  He picks up the kind trait and passions for mining and construction to go with shooting/medical passions.

Slaver raid by Gray Owl Clan.

A 9-year old child named Sjogren wants to join us and is being chased by an unknown threat.  He's psyhically hypersensitive and has a passion for mining.  We'll call him Gren.

## Jul-15-5506 (Gren, Age 10)

Gren reaches age 10.  He's going to have nothing except which bad trait he wants to pick.  Of the three choices, wimp is best.  No wait, he gets menagerist (+120% training/taming) for animal handling.  Lucky boy.

I setup (3) training dummies from smithing research and they get heavy use during the mornings.  Which is good, because melee is risky and difficult to train up.  So if our melee pawns can get to 8-10 skill with this (or more?) it will be nice.

## Sep-1-5506 (Manhunter Pack Chasing Gren)

The empress butterfly pack that was chasing Gren has shown up.  The three children got some target practice, most gained a level of shooting.

## Sep-7-5506 (Mech Cluster)

A mech cluster is landing outside the E walls.  At least it's not inside our walls.  It has a 15 day timer and a male psychic suppressor.  We do have three people with Haywire psycast.

Selena gets the greedy trait from her infection illness.

## Sep-9-5506 (Animal Plague)

Five animals have the plague.

## Sep-13-5506 (Raid: White Crag Bandits)

White Crag Bandits (WCB) are attacking from multiple directions.  We summoned a pack of animals and scored a rolling block rifle.

## Sep-15-5506 (Darla Birth)

Ding gives birth to a daughter named Darla.

## Dec-1-5506 (Abere Pregnancy)

Abere (F25, baseliner) is pregnant with Hail's (M23, baseliner) child.

Raareetium transport pod raid.  

## Dec-2-5506 (Raid: SW Seer)

SW Seer is attacking.

(Math) There are 44 neolithic technologies and I have the Tech Advance mod set to require 85% researched before we move up to medieval technology.  That means I have to research 38/44 or all but six technologies.  I have 10 unresearched technologies.  So I need to unlock four more.  At the moment I have two pawns (Val and Abere) that spend most of their time using a 30% research spot.

## Dec-9-5506 (Pillagers: Gray Owl Clan)

Larger than usual pillager raid of 11 from Gray Owl Clan.  Senga will summon a pack.

We captured Aslaug 'Person' of Deer Clan (M34, baseliner) from the raid.  They are a teetotaler ascetic and can mediate at the anima tree.  Burning passions for melee and intellectual.  A regular passion for plants.  They'll be converted, then recruited.

## Dec-15-5506 (Royal Tribute Collector)

The Royal Tribute Collector from The Purple Empire is here.  We have gold this year.  A lot of gold. Senga should be able to get to Baroness (45 honor) level.  But since we haven't built the throneroom or anything else, she's still a freeholder.  We should probably fix that at some point and get her up to the rank where her titles could be inherited.

# 5507

## Apr-4-5507 (Primeval Jubilee)

Primeval Jubilee.  Terrible, everyone gets -3 mood.

Fog reaches age 7.  He picks up passions for plants and intellectual plus the great memory trait.

## Apr-5-5507 (Sleet Birth)

Abere gives birth to Sleet (male, baseliner).

## Apr-7-5507 (Mech Cluster)

Foliage killer, low shield, five small turrets, one large turret.

## Apr-9-5507 (Aslaug Recruited)

We recruited Aslaug and he added the optimist trait.

## Apr-13-5507 (Medieval Technology Unlock)

As expected, once we researched the 38th technology (out of 44), we unlocked the next tier.  Cult of inner strength lowers everyone's break point by 5%.  The first medieval techs will be basic work benches, then stonecutting so that we can start building the megaliths that we need to keep everyone happy.

It looks like we have 44 medieval technologies, therefore we have to research 38/44 to get to industrial technologies.

Once we have the megaliths constructed, we're going to get hauling animals (probably muffalo) and start road building.

## Apr-15-5507 (Rain, Adulthood)

Rain reaches age 13.  He picks up the great memory trait to go with too smart and kind.  He picks up passions for plants, crafting, and animals.  No burning passions, so he's a jack-of-all-trades.

## Jul-3-5507 (Gren, Adulthood)

Gren reaches age 13.  He picks up optimist trait which will help with his psychic hypersensitivity.  He's now considered a tribe child and can meditate at the anima tree.  He's going to pick up melee and animals to go with his mining passion.

## Jul-8-5507 (Raid: Shadow Darts, Psycaster)

Shadow Darts (SD) are attacking with a psycaster.  

## Jul-15-5507 (Darla, Age 3)

Darla reaches age 3.

## Sep-5-5507 (2nd Reformation)

We are eligible for our next reformation.  We'll pickup the cultured meme.  

## Sep-6-5507 (Azari Joins)
