# 5500

## Apr-2 Start

- Gray Zagacorro (M40): Undergrounder, careful shooter, groundbreaker but incapable of caring.  Burning passion for cooking.  Normal passions for construction, mining, crafting.  Dislikes Mink and Blue.
- Canga Laguazami (F37): Tough and Ascetic traits.  Burning passion for intellectual, regular passions for shooting and mining.  Could be the eventual queen due to ascetic.
- Blue Treas (M13): Has the groundbreaker trait.  Passions for mining and plants, but not much skill.
- Dabami Alligator (M56): Has the jogger trait. Burning passions for mining and crafting.  
- Bascu Canpebiacur (F28): Has the careful shooter trait and is incapable of animals.  Burning passions for art and medical. Normal passions for social and mining.
- Asgu Mink (M34): Undergrounder, fast learner, ascetic.  Burning passions for social, intellectual and mining.  Normal passions for construction and crafting.  Could be the eventual king due to ascetic.

The day ends with at least a few sandstone pots created, everyone wearing warm clothing and the start of the longhouse.  The plan calls for (8) 4x6 bedrooms off of a 3-tile wide hallway.  A medical room with 8 beds and a barracks with 16 beds.  There should be enough misc space in the east-west hallway for storage and the north-south hallways will be for workstations.  We'll lose more supplies overnight as we only have two construction workers.  The pet koala already got killed by the local wildlife.

## Apr-3 (Plague)

Two of our colonists have the plague.  Bascu and Canga.

## Apr-5

Wine merchant from Bonlia Kingdom is visiting.

Bascu picks up the Kind trait from his illness.  Canga is way behind on beating the plague and will probably not survive.  Mink is now digging a grave.  Canga passes from the plague at dusk.

## Apr-6 (Colmea Founded)

Our village is now named Colmea and we are the Scorpion Tribe.

## Apr-9 (Dabami Injured)

Dabami loses his left thumb to a warg.  Dabami (M56) and Bascu (F28) are now lovers.

## Apr-10 (Fleeing Dame)

The standard shattered empire quest is here (Ospro is the NPC).  We'll accept with Mink.  

## Apr-11 (Dabami/Bascu Engagement)

Bascu and Dabami are now engaged to be married.

## Apr-12 

War merchant from the Western Republic.  Also an exotic goods trader from The Blue Stone Settlement.  We'll trade away the three cats in exchange for a telescope.

We also need to appoint a Medicine Man.

## Apr-13

Mink (M34) will become our Medicine Man.

## Jul-3 (Toxin Faction Raid)

The north and south lobes of our core that enclose a pair of geysers with 256 cells of enclosed roof are now covered.  We've started (4) 2x4 planting boxes for mushrooms.

A wine merchant from Funeamebium Kingdom is approaching.

Blue and Gray are at odds with each other, they are considered rivals.  Gray and Mink have warmed up to each other.

Single pawn raid from Toxin Fashion.  The wine merchant is still on the map, so this will be a short fight.

## Jul-5

War merchant from Central Republic.

Art patron from Empire of Goum.  

## Jul-7

Combat supplier from The White Forest Settlement.

## Jul-9 (Bascu/Dabami Wedding)

Art patron from Bonila Kingdom.

Bascu and Dabami are now married.

Combat supplier from Banwaora Concord.

## Jul-10

Combat supplier from Hatistia Coalition.

Genetics supplier from Northwest Thijalium.

Exotic goods trader from The Green Tarpit Settlement.

## Jul-12

Plague strikes Mink and Blue.

## Jul-13

Loot trader from Alarik's Clan.

War merchant from Eastern Republic.

## Jul-14

Shaman merchant from Alliance of Zaisa.

The starter wall across the valley is complete.  We are now safe from animals coming in from the east opening to the valley.

Combat supplier from Pact of Erdio.

Shaman merchant from The Red Hyena Meacar.

## Sep-2

Fungoid ship.  Very bad results.  Blue is infected and dying, no point trying to save them when they will turn into a fungoid within a few days.  Mink is down and dying, Gray doesn't do "caring" so is unable to help stabilize him.  Bascu is badly wounded, rescued with Dabami, and now confined to bed rest.  We're down to just three colonists: Bascu, Dabami and Gray.

## Sep-13

Gray has gone catatonic.  Not sure if he'll recover.  Could be a day, could be five days.

## Dec-1

Gray is awake, but still very unhappy.  A -10 because Mink died for another six days.  Then a -18 for another 16 days because Mink died (best friend malus).  He does have Catharsis (+40) for another three days.

With only three colonists left, building large structures goes on pause and the focus ends up more on survival.  That means hunting as a group whenever easy prey enters the map, getting corpses butchered and then the meat smoked.  Our best grower is only skill level 4.  I plan on planting large swathes of rice in the spring in order to level everyone up.  Or haygrass, which I should also grow.

Bascu will be the new Medicine Man.  His first eulogy will be for Pear (which I think was one of our pets at the start).  He does really badly and everyone gets a -3 mood for a week.

## Dec-6

Another tantrum from Gray.  At least he's only damaging things and not lighting the building on fire.

## Dec-8

Primeval Jubilee opportunity started in the morning.  Fortunately, it was an unforgettable sky lantern festival and everyone gets +10 mood for six days.  We also gained 20 goodwill with Inmeoum Covenant, a nearby neighbor.

## Dec-13 (Lorentz Joins)

A male, aged 55, named Lorentz Shortie has crashed nearby.  He has the kind trait and burning passions for medical and social and a high passion/skill for animals.  We'll rescue him and see if he sticks around.  

Lorentz joins.

# 5501

The year starts with four colonists and about 45 days of meals.  Hopefully, as soon as it warms up, we can plan the hay, potatoes and rice fields.  This should level up our growing skills enough to start in on the interior mushroom farms.

## Apr-1 (Kona Dynasty Raid)

Two raiders from Kona Dynasty are attacking.  I suspect the hungry wildlife outside is going to get them.

Oh good, Lorentz has enough skill to start planting mushrooms.

## Apr-2 (Caskcut Joins)

One of the shuttle crash survivors, Caskcut (M44) with the Kind trait has joined.  A burning passion for shooting and normal passion for mining/animals.

## Apr-3

Conversion ritual for Lorentz.  An effective ritual that dropped his certainty to 69%.

## Apr-10 (Raid, Toxin Faction)

The Toxin Faction is attacking with a single pawn.  They stole a warg corpse and left.

## Apr-13 (Slavers from Svenke's Clan)

Slavers from Svenke's Clan are attacking.  They decided to play with the maddened mooose and find out how bad moose bites can be.

## Jul-2

Lorentz/Gray get into a social fight about religion and Lorentz loses his left ring finger.

## Jul-5

We're about halfway done with our first researched technology (Cement Making).  This technology gives us low effort generation of building materials.  It takes a single stone chunk and produces 75 concrete blocks (up from the 20 standard stone blocks).  The labor required is minimal as you only have to load the stone chunk into the press and then pull the results out later.  The downsides are that you can't control which stone chunk gets used and the concrete blocks are weaker than granite blocks.  Granite walls are 425hp and concrete block walls are 340hp.  This is stronger than marble (300hp) and roughly equivalent to sandstone (350hp) walls.  The cement press is also expensive to build (150 blocks).

## Jul-7 (Pillage Raid, Svenke's Clan)

Three vikings from Svenke's Clan are attacking.  Their goal is to burn and loot.

## Sep-3

A psychic storm bolt strikes Dabami.  While she was indoors.

## Dec-3

Bulk goods trader from Aralik's Clan.

## Dec-8 (1st Reformation)

Primitive Jubilee.  Dabami and Caskcut got into a short social fight, with no permanent injuries.  It was unforgettable, giving us +10 mood for 6 days and 20 goodwill with Inmeoum Covenant.

We've earned enough ideology points to have our first reformation. We'll pickup the meme, Collectivist to go with Emancipation.  We'll add a Symbol Burning party and the Immunity:Enhanced precept.

## Dec-10

Dabami and Bascu have muscle parasites.

## Dec-12

Another fungoid ship.  Let's see if we can avoid killing half our colonists this time.

# 5502

## Apr-1 (Caith)

Caith has crashed nearby from one of the nearby civil settlements.  She is 49 and a Kitul with passions for shooting and melee.  She's a night owl, so will live on the opposite schedule from the rest of us.  We got her inside the walls right before a raider from The Grey Mole Engo showed up.  She does have paralytic abasia and will need to be confined to bed rest for another 36 days.

## Apr-2 (Lorentz Converted)

Bascu was able to convert Lorentz to Primitive Creed.

## Apr-3

Loaned out Caskcut for 14 days.

## Apr-4

A 12 year old Kitul named Hogan is begging for refuge.  She has the brave trait, but no passions and belongs to an alternate ideology that we'll have to convert her out of.  

## Apr-10

Lorentz has level 8 in planting, allowing us to plant heal root and mycothread mushrooms.  I still don't have any pawns with passions in plants.

## Apr-14 (Hogan Adulthood)

Hogan has reached the age of 13 and picked up the beautiful trait.  But zero passions.

## Jul-2 

Caskcut has returned.

## Sep-1 (Raid, Choke Trash)

Five raiders from Choke Trash.  Well, three.  Two of them are wild humans.  

## Sep-3 (Caskcut Converted)

Caskcut has converted to Primitive Creed.

## Sep-5 (Flu)

Flu strikes Caith, Bascu, Lorentz, and Dabami.  That's both of our primary doctors.  This is why I like to take Immunity:Advanced as a precept.  Hogan does at least have 7 skill in Medical, so she'll be our doctor for the duration.

## Sep-7

Caith is awake.

## Sep-8

Caith survives the flu and gains the Great Memory trait.

## Sep-12 (Lorentz/Caith Lovers)

Lorentz (M57) and Caith (F50) are now lovers.

## Sep-14

Smithing technology completed.

## Dec-8

Primitive Jubilee.  

# 5503

## Apr-3 (Lorentz/Caith Engagement)

Lorentz and Caith are now engaged.

## Apr-5 (Flu)

Caith has caught the flu.

## Apr-15 (Raid, Trum'Kariss Pact)

Three ranged raiders from Trum'Kariss Pact have shown up.

## Jul-5

War merchant from Alarik's Clan.

## Jul-15 (Raid, Lothen)

A few tribals from Lothen showed up.

## Sep-6 (Lorentz/Caith Marriage)

Lorentz/Caith are now married.

## Dec-2 (Slaver Raid, Svenke's Clan)

Slavers from Svenke's Clan are attacking.  Time to use them to fertilize our plants.

## Dec-4 (Fungoid Ship)

Another fungoid ship.

## Dec-5 (Psycaster Raid, The Cannons)

Raiders with psycaster skills are attacking.  The psycaster also has a long-range gauss lance.  So this might be painful. Gray (M43) lost his right kidney to a shot from the gauss lance.

## Dec-8

Primitive Jubilee.  It was unforgettable, giving us the points needed to have our 2nd reformation.  Sharpshooter is a good meme to pickup, even with the unhappy thoughts from engaging in melee combat.  The increased range on weapons is really useful.  

## Dec-10 (Crica Joins)

A wanderer named Crica (M46) has joined.  He is a psychopath undergrounder, with a burning passion for crafting.  He also has passions for construction, mining and cooking.  He's already a member of our Primitive Creed ideology.

## Dec-15 (Crica Betrayal)

Crica betrays us.

# 5504

## Apr-1 (Pillage Raid, Svenke's Clan)

Six attackers from Svenke's Clan.

## Apr-7 (Raid, The Burglar Monsters)

Attackers from The Burglar Monsters.  

## Apr-13 (Dabami Gains Frail)

Dabami turned 61 today and now he has the frail health condition.

We now have a female norwegian forest cat (age 7) named Ripple.  

## Jul-1 (Lorentz Injuries)

Lorentz loses his left eye and left second toe while trying to tame an arcturan sky eel.

## Jul-15 (Toxic Fallout Starts)

Toxic fallout has begun over the region.  Immediately follwed by a cold snap.

## Sep-8 (Toxic Fallout Ends)

The toxic fallout event has ended.

Started converting granite walls (425hp) to concrete (cement) block walls (340hp) in the interior.  This is mostly because we're short on granite blocks for the outer defenses.  Not enough bodies to work the quarry non-stop.  With six cement presses producing concrete blocks, we have an abundance of that type.

## Sep-14 (Erb Joins)

Erb, age 6, is being chased by imps from League of Haktchz.  He is a baseliner who dislikes his existing ideology (Bagucinquan Party) where he is a disliked xenotype.

## Dec-12

A trained combat medic, incabable of skilled work, has crashed in a pod.  Her name is Isis and she is age 35.  She joins us after being rescued.  She'll make a good doctor and general hauler/cleaner.

## Dec-14 (Erb, Age 7)

Poor Erb, he gets to pick from either lush, kleptomaniac or insatiable traits.  I rolled and he gets the insatiable trait.

# 5505

## Apr-7 (Gray/Isis Lovers)

Gray (M45) and Isis (F35) are now lovers.  But Isis' ideology prevents them from sharing a bed.

## Apr-8 (Erb Conversion)

Lorentz managed to convert Erb to our ideology.

## Apr-9 (Raid, The Gray Mole Engo)

Four tribal raiders from The Gray Mole Engo are attacking.

## Jul-5 (Neighbors)

Looking at the map, we are very isolated which is why we hardly ever see traders.  Our nearest friendly neighbors are 9-10 days away in each direction.

- Sprayberry, The White Forest Settlement (ENE, 9.5 days, purple sheriff star icon)
- Kodo Citadel, The Empire of Guom (E, 9.5 days, cyan castle tower icon)
- Dancer's River, The White Forest Settlement (E, 12.5 days, purple sheriff star icon)
- Hope's Mountain, Hatistia Coalition (NW, 24.5 days, purple house icon)

Possible trade items (things we have an excess amount of or could make):

- Cloth Winter Socks ($52/0.05kg = $1040/kg)
- Heavy Fur Mittens ($112/0.15kg = $746/kg)
- Cloth ($1.49/0.03kg = $49.7/kg)
- Heavy Fur ($2.93/0.03kg = $97.7/kg)
- Smoked Vegetables ($3.66/0.02kg = $183/kg)
- Mushroom ($2.14/0.05kg = $42.8/kg)

## Jul-6 (Raid, The Gun Robbers)

Four hostiles from The Gun Robbers are attacking.  Two of them have makeshift LMGs.

## Jul-10 (Psychic Rain, Aging)

A psychic rain has spread over the area (purple letter event from Vanilla Expanded).  Anyone caught outside is going to age rapidly. Could last for a season or years.  If it lasts too much into 5506, we could be in trouble.  We're low on charcoal/coal (under 1000) and only have 3500 wood on hand.

In the meantime, we'll be catching up on neolithic research once we run out of other things to do.  Maybe we get up to the industrial technology level.

## Sep-9 (Isis/Gray Breakup)

Isis proposed to Gray but he turned her down.

## Sep-14 (Erb, Age 10)

Erb has reached age 10.  He picks up the neat trait and a passion for cooking.

## Sep-15

The psychic rain continues (day 20).  One option for reducing the demands on the main colony will be to make use of [Vanilla Outposts Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2688941031) which I already have installed.  I just need to kit out colonists with 7-15 days worth of food and send them out as a caravan to settle some type of outpost.  Probably a logging outpost to start.  Once the outpost is created, it's completely passive unless they get attacked.

We're down to 500 charcoal and 2700 wood.  That's about 25 charcoal/coal per day and 50 wood per day.

## Dec-8

Primitive Jubilee.  We took the risk even with the psychic rain.  It gave everyone +6 mood for six days.

## Dec-10

Dealing with a stack of pemmican that has food poisoning due to Hogan's ineptitude at cooking.  She's been removed from the position, leaving only Gray to cook for us.

# 5506

## Apr-5 (Flu)

Four colonists have the flu: Isis, Lorentz, Hogan, Caskcut.

## Apr-9

Hogan gains the masochistic trait from the flu.

Ripple (our 8 year old cat) has caught the plague.

Raid by Trum'Karis Pact.  A party of six with shotguns and revolvers.  We'll bait them past the pillbox.

We've been under the psychic rain for 44 days now.  We have about twenty pairs of socks ready for transport.  Going to create fifty pairs for any caravan.  I think once I have 50 pairs of good (or better) quality socks, I'm going to send four colonists on a journey with all the pemmican they can carry.  I'm tempted to send Caith as well as a 5th.

## Jul-3

Caravan formed with:

- Caskcut (M49)
- Lorentz (M61)
- Hogan (F20)
- Isis (F37)
- Caith (F)

Carrying:

- 1600 hardtack
- 277 pemmican (which I think is the 'bad' stack)
- 5 light wool bedrolls
- 1 heavy vur double bedroll
- 62 cloth winter socks of various quality

Target: Kodo Citadel (9.1 days) owned by The Empire of Guom.

I'm a little worried that they left with only 15 healroot (each carrying 3).  Hopefully it works out.

## Jul-14

Caravan arrives at Kodo Citadel without incident.  Going back is 25-30 days instead of the 9-10 days that it took us to get here.  That may be because we'll be getting back towards the dead of winter.  It means we'll only be coming back with 240 gold and an additional 219 silver.  Which is a bit stinky.  We have 26.2 days of food left for the trip home.  That might be about half a day too little.  Hopefully we make it.  It's a shame we couldn't have bought up some of the slaves at the citadel.

The other problem with this trip is the patches of the planet covered in pollution between us and the citadel.  Road building for any further trips is going to be a requirement.

## Sep-2 (Erb, Adulthood)

Erb has reached age 13.  He is picking up the coward trait and passions for medical and crafting.

## Sep-4 (Isis, Dementia)

Isis has developed dementia due to the toxic build-up.  We're going to leave her behind as an hunting outpost.  Pawns in "outposts" kind of go into stasis and become self-sufficient.  This also frees up a bit of food for the journey home with the remaining four members.

## Sep-5

Ripple has caught the plague again.

About 20 days until the caravan returns.  If they get close, but the psychic rain is still going, they're going to stop and form a lumber camp.

## Dec-7

The remaining four pawns in the caravan have created a lumber outpost that will ship us wood about once per year.  It's still doing the psychic rain at Colmea and it's been 1.5 years so far.  We're completely out of charcoal and are growing timbercap mushrooms in an attempt to stay ahead of our wood needs.  Timbercap is pretty inefficient compared to an outdoor popular tree setup.  We'd be in really bad shape if we hadn't settled our main building between a pair of steam geysers and setup garden areas for mushrooms.

Some inventory:

- 3400 mushrooms
- 1200 smoked vegetables
- 600 barley
- 300 smoked meat
- 2300 hardtack
- 2800 silage
- 2400 kibble
- 3200 hay
- 300 suspect pemmican
- 1500 wood
