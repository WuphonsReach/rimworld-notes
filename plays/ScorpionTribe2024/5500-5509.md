# 5500

## Apr-2 Start

- Gray Zagacorro (M40): Undergrounder, careful shooter, groundbreaker but incapable of caring.  Burning passion for cooking.  Normal passions for construction, mining, crafting.  Dislikes Mink and Blue.
- Canga Laguazami (F37): Tough and Ascetic traits.  Burning passion for intellectual, regular passions for shooting and mining.  Could be the eventual queen due to ascetic.
- Blue Treas (M13): Has the groundbreaker trait.  Passions for mining and plants, but not much skill.
- Dabami Alligator (M56): Has the jogger trait. Burning passions for mining and crafting.  
- Bascu Canpebiacur (F28): Has the careful shooter trait and is incapable of animals.  Burning passions for art and medical. Normal passions for social and mining.
- Asgu Mink (M34): Undergrounder, fast learner, ascetic.  Burning passions for social, intellectual and mining.  Normal passions for construction and crafting.  Could be the eventual king due to ascetic.

The day ends with at least a few sandstone pots created, everyone wearing warm clothing and the start of the longhouse.  The plan calls for (8) 4x6 bedrooms off of a 3-tile wide hallway.  A medical room with 8 beds and a barracks with 16 beds.  There should be enough misc space in the east-west hallway for storage and the north-south hallways will be for workstations.  We'll lose more supplies overnight as we only have two construction workers.  The pet koala already got killed by the local wildlife.

## Apr-3 (Plague)

Two of our colonists have the plague.  Bascu and Canga.  Canga fails to beat it and dies.

## Apr-5 (Canga Dies)

Wine merchant from Bonlia Kingdom is visiting.

Bascu picks up the Kind trait from his illness.  Canga is way behind on beating the plague and will probably not survive.  Mink is now digging a grave.  Canga passes from the plague at dusk.

## Apr-6 (Colmea Founded)

Our village is now named Colmea and we are the Scorpion Tribe.  Will probably make Mink the ideology leader (High Chief) and Bascu the moral guide (Medicine Man).

## Apr-10 (Raid, Burglar Monsters)

Single pawn raid by Burglar Monsters.  

## Apr-13 (Gray's Wife)

A war merchant from Western Republic is approaching.  His wife, Maximiliana Ahenobarbus (F33) is one of the guards for the caravan.  

## Apr-14 (Roles Change)

- Mink the ideology leader (High Chief) 
- Bascu the moral guide (Medicine Man)

The outer fence line is almost complete.

Rescued an animus vox (F5) named Goblin.  These are small canines with the psionic ability to spread happiness.

## Jul-1

War merchant from Noco Coalition.

## Jul-2

A wine merchant from Funeamebium Kingdom is approaching.

## Jul-5

A wine merchant from Empire of Goum. 

## Jul-7 (Raid, White Mesa Settlement)

Two pawn raid from the White Mesa Settlement.  Both equipped with shotguns.

## Jul-10

Combat supplier from Northwest Thijalium.  We were able to purchase a good quality service rifle (31 range, 10 dmg) from them for Blue to use.

Art patron from Bonila Kingdom.

## Jul-11

Bulk goods trader from The Green Tarpit Settlement.

## Jul-12

War merchant from Alarik's Clan.

## Jul-14

War merchant from The Red Hyena Meacar.

Bulk goods trader from Eastern Republic.

## Sep-2

Going into winter with about 50 days of food for five people.  The outer fence line is now a double fence line.  We have our first granite pillbox constructed.  

## Sep-4 (Gray/Bascu Lovers)

Gray (M40) and Bascu (F29) are now lovers.

## Sep-9 (Gray/Bascu Engagement)

Gray and Bascu are now engaged.

## Sep-11 (Pillage Raid, Svenke's Clan)

Pillagers from Svenke's Clan are attacking.

## Dec-2 (Slaver Raid, Svenke's Clan)

Slaver raid from Svenke's Clan.

## Dec-7 (Neighbors)

Looking at the map, we are very isolated which is why we hardly ever see traders.  Our nearest friendly neighbors are 9-10 days (one-way) away during the summer and about 25-30 days during winter.  We'll need to use Roads of the Rim (RotR) mod to build some dirt/stone roads out towards those settlements.

- Sprayberry, The White Forest Settlement (ENE, 9.5 days, purple sheriff star icon).
- Kodo Citadel, The Empire of Guom (E, 9.5 days, cyan castle tower icon), but past some polluted areas.
- Dancer's River, The White Forest Settlement (E, 12.5 days, purple sheriff star icon)
- Hope's Mountain, Hatistia Coalition (NW, 24.5 days, purple house icon)

Possible trade items (things we have an excess amount of or could make):

- Cloth Winter Socks ($52/0.05kg = $1040/kg)
- Heavy Fur Mittens ($112/0.15kg = $746/kg)
- Cloth ($1.49/0.03kg = $49.7/kg)
- Heavy Fur ($2.93/0.03kg = $97.7/kg)
- Smoked Vegetables ($3.66/0.02kg = $183/kg)
- Mushroom ($2.14/0.05kg = $42.8/kg)

Looking at the map, a lot of factions only have a single outpost.  And I think two of the three "republics" have lost theirs.

## Dec-8 

Primeval Jubilee opportunity started in the morning.

## Dec-9

We're going to send Dabami away to serve The White Empire (shattered empire) for 11 days.

## Dec-13 (Raid, White Mesa Settlement)

Raiders from The White Mesa Settlement are attacking.  The "Raids Go Wrong" mod fired and they were attacked by half a dozen swarmlings.  Now the raiders are dead, but we have to kill the swarmlings.

# 5501

## Apr-2 (Bascu Pregnancy)

Bascu (F29) is pregnant.

## Apr-5 (Dabami Returns)

Dabami returns along with (3) doses of aperitif.  Those are useful for gut worms and food poisoning incidents to reset the colonist's digestion.

## Apr-6

The Empire of Goum has expanded from the Kodo Citadel to a second location to the southeast named Mosquito's Stronghold-by-the-Prairie.  That's a bit further away from us, but does give the Empire of Guom a second location.

## Apr-7 (Bascu/Gray Marriage)

Bascu and Gray are getting married today.

## Jul-5 (Raro Birth, Plague)

Bascu gave birth after about 7 hours of labor.  A baby boy named Raro.

Three of our colonists have caught the plague: Dabami, Gray, Mink.  Dabami (M58) doesn't look like he's going to get ahead of it before it kills him.

## Jul-7 (Dabami's Death)

Dabami succumbed to the plague.  We had a good quality ancient mourning the following day.

## Jul-9

Mink gained the fun-loving trait due to fighting off the deadly illness.

## Jul-12

A drifter named Kamira (M15) wants to stay with us for 18 days.  He has the pessimist and hard worker traits.  No useful skills or passions.  We'll put him to work doing cleaning and hauling.

## Sep-1 (Raid, Trum'Kariss Pact)

A raider from Trum'Kariss Pact is attacking.

## Sep-15 (Kamira Leaves)

Kamira leaves.

## Dec-8 

Primeval Jubilee.

# 5502

## Apr-5 (Raro, Age 3)

Raro has attained the age of three.

## Apr-8 (Raid, Loreilue Tribe)

Three tribals from Loreilue Tribe are attacking.

## Jul-10 (Bascu Pregnancy)

Bascu (F30) is pregnant again with Gray's (M42) child.  Given that Bascu is our only doctor, this is going to be a high risk delivery.

## Sep-10 (Raid, Burglar Monsters)

Four melee raiders from The Burglar Monsters are attacking.  Looks like "Sometimes Raids Go Wrong" (SRGW) fired some mechs (3x Militor) have spawned in.

## Sep-15 (Naque Birth)

Bascu gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Naque.

## Dec-3 (Oyys Joins)

A gwennin named Oyys (F40) wants to join.  She is incapable of caring, intellectual or artistic.  She refuses to butcher animals and wants to be bonded to a pet.  She has the body purist, gourmand, animal lover and kind traits.  A burning passion in animals and regular passions for social, melee and shooting.  Will probably just have her haul and clean around the core.

## Dec-7 (Oyys Conversion)

I added the "T's Conversion Staff" mod and have been equipping a Conversion Rod whenever I try to convert a friendly pawn.  It boosts the change of certainty by 100%.  So it only took one conversion attempt and one conversion ritual to convert Oyys to our ideology.  

The pack of manhunter Crystalline Caracals (heavily modified wildcat) have arrived due to Oyys.

## Dec-8 (1st Reformation)

Primeval Jubilee.  We gained enough points to have our first reformation. We'll pickup the Collectivist meme to go with Emancipation.  We'll add a Symbol Burning party and the Immunity:Enhanced precept.

## Dec-10 (Schnook Joins)

An 8-year old baseliner child named Schnook wants to join us.  They are trigger-happy with a passion for animals.

# 5503

## Apr-3-5503

Pact of Erdio defeats Gun Robbers at Allworth.  This multicultural union faction now has three outposts on a semi-isolated island near the south pole.  They are neutral to us, with a natural goodwill of -10 due to our ideology memes conflicting (individualist vs collectivist).  They look like one of the larger factions on the map, most factions have single outposts.

Schnook has been converted to our ideology by Bascu.

## Apr-4-5503 (Raro Age 7)

Raro has reached age 7 and picks up a passion for plants and the psychopath trait.

## Apr-13-5503 (Plague)

Plague has struck both Schnook (M9) and Naque (M1).  They should both easily beat it due to the Immunity:Enhanced precept added at the end of last year.

## Jul-1-5503 (Cold Snap)

Got a cold snap which killed off a handful of plants.  It barely got down to -10C and it could have been far worse.  But we'll lose more of the crops over the next few nights.

## Jul-2-5503 (Raid, Trum'Kariss Pact)

Five saurids from Trum'Kariss Pact are attacking and a few have ranged weapons.

## Jul-5-5503 (Schnook Age 10)

Schnook has reached age 10 and picks up the plants passion.  But he also picks up the wimp trait.

We're going to let the empire test a volcanic winter for 8 days in exchange for goodwill.

## Jul-6-5503 (Royal Tribute Collector)

The Royal Tribute Collector from The White Empire has arrived.  Going to start in on making Mink a noble.

## Jul-15-5503 (Naque, Age 3)

Naque has reached age 3.

## Sep-1-5503 (Marina, Female Labrador Retriever)

A female labrador retriever named Marina has joined.  She is age 6.

## Sep-8-5503 (Guard Pet Quest)

We've accepted a quest from the empire to guard a pet elk.  We will be attacked with a double-strength raid by Choke Trash (Wasters) sometime in the next few days.  There will about 13 attackers with ranged modern weapons.  We do get a single empire pawn to control for the duration.

In addition an imperial ship is crashing on our map and we'll have to defend the surviving crew from attackers.  A little annoying that it crashed in the middle of our farm fields.  But that's a blessing as it's inside the walled perimeter.  Besides that, it's winter and there are no plants being grown.

## Sep-11-5503 (Oyys Loaned Out)

Oyys has been loaned out for 13 days in exchange for +31 goodwill with the empire.  That gets us up to allied, which means they will potentially drop reinforcements when that large raid arrives.

## Sep-13-5503 (Pilstl Joins)

A rescued shuttle crash survivor named Pilstl (F28) has joined us.  She has the brawler and insomniac traits and is incapable of social.  Passions in melee, animals and artistic.

## Sep-15-5503 (Plague)

Blue and Pilstl have caught the plague.

## Dec-2-5503 (Pilstl Dies)

Pilstl dies to the plague.  Blue gains the steadfast trait from fighting off the illness.

## Dec-3-5503 (Choke Trash Raid)

The Choke Trash raid has arrived.

## Dec-5-5503 (Raro, Age 10)

Raro reaches age 10 and picks up the thick-skinned trait.  Plus passions for intellectual and animals.
